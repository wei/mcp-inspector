 *
 * The full notification history still lives in the Protocol tab; these toasts
 * are the at-a-glance, in-context signal. Toasts are keyed by progress stream
 * (see `progressToastId`) and replaced per tick, so a chatty server updates one
 * toast rather than stacking one per tick.
 *
 * Returns nothing — the recorded exception to #2128's "each hook returns one
 * object" criterion, which exists to stop a hook handing back a long list of
 * loose values (`useTabUiState`'s twenty-two is the case it was written
 * against). This hook subscribes, shows toasts and unsubscribes; the only
 * state it owns is toast-id bookkeeping the caller must not see. An empty
 * object would advertise an API that is not there.
