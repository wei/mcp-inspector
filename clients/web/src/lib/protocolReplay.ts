 * three ways, each of which the Edit-and-replay editor has to catch before
 * Send:
 *
 * - `arguments: null` is nullish, so `?? {}` replaces it — the editor shows
 *   `null` and the wire carries `{}`.
 * - `arguments: [1,2]` or `arguments: 4` is not nullish, so the cast carries it
 *   through unchanged into a call whose type says it is a named-argument
 *   record. Nothing reshapes it, but nothing can send it either.
 * - For **`prompts/get`**, a non-string *value*. `getPrompt` runs
 *   `convertPromptArguments`, which `JSON.stringify`s anything that is not
 *   already a string — so `{"count": 2}` is sent as `{"count": "2"}` while the
 *   editor still shows the number. This is not a quirk to route around: the
 *   spec types `GetPromptRequest.params.arguments` as `Record<string, string>`,
 *   so a string is the only thing a prompt argument can be.
 * - For **`tools/call`**, the mirror image. `callTool` runs every *string*
 *   entry through `convertToolParameters`, because the Tools form hands
 *   everything over as text — so `{"count": "2"}` against a schema declaring a
 *   number is sent as `{"count": 2}`. Detected by running that same conversion
 *   and comparing, rather than by reimplementing its rules, so the two cannot
 *   drift. Needs the `tool`; without one this check is skipped, since nothing
 *   can be said about a coercion whose schema is unknown.
 *
 * `name` and `uri` are deliberately not checked here: the dispatch already
 * refuses a missing or non-string one with a reason the caller surfaces as a
 * toast, so those fail visibly rather than silently.
