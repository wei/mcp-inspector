 * The app capabilities exactly as the view sent them, per bridge.
 *
 * `AppBridge.getAppCapabilities()` cannot be used for `elicitation` (#1854):
 * ext-apps 1.7.5 parses the view's `ui/initialize` params through
 * `McpUiAppCapabilitiesSchema`, a plain Zod object, so any key that schema does
 * not declare is **stripped before the bridge stores it**. `elicitation` is
 * exactly such a key — it is what ext-apps#733 adds — so an app that correctly
 * advertises it looks, through the bridge's own accessor, like an app that did
 * not. That silently turns every negotiated elicitation into a native-UI
 * fallback, which is indistinguishable from "the feature is off".
 *
 * So the raw frame is observed on the way in and recorded here. A WeakMap keeps
 * this per-bridge (never global) and lets the entry die with the bridge.
 *
 * Delete this module when ext-apps ships #733: `getAppCapabilities()` will
 * carry `elicitation` itself, and {@link appAdvertisesElicitation} already
 * prefers that value.

 * nominal type from the v2 client's, though runtime-identical — so naming
 * either would force a cast at the call site. Generic rather than
 * `(message: unknown)` because a handler typed for a narrower message is not
 * assignable to one typed for `unknown` (contravariance), which would put the
 * cast back; `rest` is `never[]` for the same reason, accepting any trailing
 * parameter list without claiming to know it. The message is only ever read
