// modal and the *form above it* got clipped at the right edge (measured).
// Clamped text still wraps internally, so its max-content is merely its
// longest word, and the container stays the modal's width; the clamp then

// renders a `<p>`, so a nested one would be a `<p>` inside a `<p>` (invalid,
