      //   or Korean input method commits the candidate being composed, and that
      //   keystroke means "accept this word", not "new line". Acting on it
      //   would enlarge the field and insert a stray newline every time such a
      //   user finished a word, making the field unusable for them.
      // - `keyCode === 229` is the same guard again, for WebKit. It is reported
      //   to fire `compositionend` *before* the committing keydown, which
      //   leaves `isComposing` already false by the time this runs; 229 is the
      //   pre-`isComposing` sentinel for "this key went to the IME" and is
      //   still set there. Kept despite `keyCode` being deprecated because
      //   nothing non-deprecated distinguishes that event, and it cannot misfire
      //   on a real Enter, which reports 13.
      // - The Ctrl/Cmd/Alt chords are deliberately left alone: those read as
