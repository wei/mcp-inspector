/**
 * Drift guard for the MCP Apps UI advertisement (#1740). `UI_EXTENSION_KEY` is
 * hardcoded in core (ext-apps' `EXTENSION_ID` still lives only on the `/server`
 * subpath as of 2.0.0, which the browser build must not import). A conforming
 * server keys its Apps lookup on the extension id and checks the client's
 * advertised `mimeTypes` before serving an App, so a drifted string silently
 * stops Apps working against strict servers.
 *
 * `MCP_APP_MIME_TYPE` is no longer a copy — since ext-apps 2.0.0 core re-exports
 * `RESOURCE_MIME_TYPE` (#1745) — so its case here is a re-export check rather
 * than a drift check; it stays so the advertisement is asserted end to end.
 *
 * This runs in the node integration project, where importing the `/server`
 * value resolves — the one place the extension id can actually be compared.
