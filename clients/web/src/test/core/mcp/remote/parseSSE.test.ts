/**
 * `parseSSE` cross-chunk frame loss.
 *
 * The reproduction needs no browser and no network: `parseSSE` takes a reader,
 * so a test supplies the chunk boundary directly instead of hoping a real
 * transport happens to produce one. That is what makes this defect testable at
 * all — on the wire the split is a function of payload size, TCP segmentation
 * and any proxy in between, none of which a test can steer.
 *
 * The bug: `currentEvent` / `currentData` are declared INSIDE the read loop, so
 * a frame whose `data:` line arrives in one chunk and whose terminating blank
 * line arrives in the next is discarded. `buffer` already carries a partial
 * *line* across reads; nothing carries a partial *frame*.
