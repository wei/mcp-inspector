/**
 * The secret-storage descriptor's presentation helpers (#1950).

 * These are shared by the terminal banner and the browser footer, which is
 * the whole reason they live in `core/auth/` rather than beside either
 * consumer — so the cases below are about the *statements* they make,
 * particularly which states are loud and which are quiet. A helper that
 * quietly stopped warning about a plaintext file would leave both surfaces
 * silently wrong at once.
