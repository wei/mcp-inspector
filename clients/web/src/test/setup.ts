// Benign default `fetch`. Several components hit the backend on mount — e.g.
// the app reads `GET /api/config` via `useInitialConfig`.
// Under happy-dom (no server) those real requests 404 and log alarming
// `GET .../api/config 404 (Not Found)` lines that make a green run look broken.
// Returning an empty 200 keeps such *incidental* calls quiet. Tests that care
// about fetch install their own per-test spy/stub (e.g. `vi.spyOn(globalThis,
// "fetch")`), which Vitest only auto-reverts to this baseline if the test
// registers it through Vitest's mock APIs — this project doesn't set
// `restoreMocks` globally, so a test that mutates `globalThis.fetch` directly
// must restore it itself. Note the tradeoff: this default is permissive, so a
// test meaning to assert on a fetch FAILURE must set up its own rejecting/
// erroring stub rather than relying on the absence of a server.

// after the environment is torn down and throws `window is not defined` from

// test passed. Report `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` so Mantine transitions
// render instantly (no timers); all other queries stay `false`, matching the
// prior (absent-matchMedia) behavior so `useMediaQuery`-driven layout is
