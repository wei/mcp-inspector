# MCP Inspector Web Client

The browser incarnation of the Inspector: a **Vite + React + [Mantine](https://mantine.dev)** single-page app backed by a small **Node (Hono)** server. The SPA is presentational — it renders data and fires callbacks; all MCP state comes from the shared `@inspector/core` hooks. The backend proxies MCP connections, serves the built SPA, and exposes `/api/*`.

This README covers what's specific to the web client. For the repo-wide picture (the `@inspector/core` shared package, the "dumb components" philosophy, the top-level `validate`/`coverage`/`ci` scripts, and publishing), see the [root README](../../README.md).

## Two halves: `src/` (browser) and `server/` (Node)

| Path      | Runs in | Purpose                                                       |
| --------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/`    | browser | The React SPA — components, hooks, theme, entry (`main.tsx`). |
| `server/` | Node    | The dev/prod backend wiring (never imported by the browser).  |

The `server/` directory holds the Node-only backend:

- **`vite-hono-plugin.ts`** — mounts the Hono `/api/*` middleware onto the Vite dev server (so `npm run dev` has a live backend).
- **`server.ts`** — the standalone Hono production server (serves `dist/` + `/api/*`).
- **`run-web.ts`** / **`start-vite-dev-server.ts`** — entry points the launcher calls for prod `--web` and `--web --dev`.
- **`web-server-config.ts`** — env parsing, the `GET /api/config` payload, the startup banner, the default origin allow-list.
- **`resolve-bind-host.ts`** — the shared bind-host guard (refuses an all-interfaces `HOST` unless `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES`), used by both bind points (`web-server-config.ts` + `vite.config.ts`); see [Host binding & the origin allow-list](#host-binding--the-origin-allow-list).
- **`inject-auth-token.ts`** — embeds the API token into the served `index.html` (see [Auth token](#auth-token)).
- **`sandbox-controller.ts`** — the MCP Apps sandbox HTTP server; **`app-origin-controller.ts`** — the dedicated app-origin server for `_meta.ui.domain` (see [MCP App dedicated origins](#mcp-app-dedicated-origins-metauidomain)); **`ensure-web-build.ts`** — builds `dist/` on demand for prod `--web`; **`vite-base-config.ts`** — shared `optimizeDeps` exclusions.
- **`browser-externalized-builtin-gate.ts`** — Vite-agnostic build-gate logic that fails `vite build` when a Node built-in reaches the browser bundle (#1769); the thin Vite plugin wiring lives in `vite.config.ts`. It sits under `server/` (rather than `src/`) as the home for Node-only, build-time tooling — it's imported by the Vite config, never by the browser — alongside the other `vite-*` config helpers here.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev        # Vite dev server + Hono /api middleware, HMR
```

For the launcher-driven prod/dev flows (`npm run web` / `web:dev`), see the root README — those run the built launcher.

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # tsc -b  →  vite build  →  build:runner
```

Two artifacts come out, both of which ship in the published package:

- **`dist/`** — the browser SPA (`vite build`). Served statically by the prod backend.
- **`build/`** — the Node prod-server runner (`build:runner` = `tsup --config tsup.runner.config.ts`), which bundles `server/` + `@inspector/core` into one ESM file and externalizes npm deps.

`build:client` runs only the `vite build` half when you just need fresh `dist/`.

## Component layers

Components live under `src/components/` in four layers, smallest to largest:

| Layer       | Count | What it is                                                                     |
| ----------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `elements/` | ~31   | Leaf presentational pieces (badges, buttons, toggles) over Mantine primitives. |
| `groups/`   | ~63   | Composite pieces (cards, panels, modals, control bars).                        |
| `screens/`  | ~11   | Full tab screens (Tools, Resources, Servers, monitoring screens…).             |
| `views/`    | 1     | `InspectorView` — the top-level layout that composes the screens.              |

Every screen and element has a `*.stories.tsx` (see [Storybook](#storybook)). Styling follows the Mantine-first rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) — theme variants and component props over CSS, `--inspector-*` tokens over raw colors.

## Tool-schema portability (`#1005`)

The Tools tab flags tools whose advertised `inputSchema` / `outputSchema`
carries a construct that is legal JSON Schema and is refused or mishandled by
real MCP clients — the reported case being Go's `jsonschema` package emitting a
bare `true` for an `interface{}` field, which Claude Code rejects with an
opaque `"Invalid input"`.

Two surfaces, one verdict: the sidebar row (`ToolListItem`) carries a
hover-labelled icon — red when something is refused outright, yellow when it is
merely handled unevenly — and selecting the tool renders a **Schema
portability** section (`SchemaFindingsList`) above the argument form, one block
per finding with its path, the problem, and a concrete fix.

Both read [`core/json/schemaLint.ts`](../../core/json/schemaLint.ts), which is
also what backs the TUI's detail pane and the CLI's `--strict` report — so the
three clients cannot disagree about whether a schema is portable. That module's
header explains why it is a portability lint rather than a JSON Schema
validator. `test-servers/configs/unportable-schemas-http.json` is a server that
exercises every rule.

## Non-component code: `src/lib` vs `src/utils`

Two grab-bag directories, split by one rule: **`utils` = functions that compute; `lib` = things that instantiate, adapt, or touch the environment.** If it does I/O or wraps a subsystem, it's `lib`; if it's a pure transform, it's `utils`.

- **`src/utils/`** — pure, side-effect-free functions (no DOM/`window`/`sessionStorage` I/O, no subsystem ownership), trivially unit-testable with no mocks. Examples: `jsonUtils`, `schemaUtils`, `toolUtils`, `maskSecrets`, `inspectorTabs`, `deepLink`, `mcpNetworkHeaders`, `errorFormat`, `stepUp`, and the toast ids/formatters under `utils/toasts/`. Carve-outs that stay `utils`:
  - _Diagnostic logging_ (`console.warn`/`console.error`) doesn't count as a side effect.
  - _Importing from `@inspector/core`_ — neither a type-only import nor re-exporting core's pure functions/constants is a subsystem dependency (what makes a module `lib` is wrapping core's stateful runtime).
  - _Pure domain types + their constructors_ (`customHeaders`) — there is no `types/` sub-bucket inside `lib`/`utils`.
- **`src/lib/`** — infrastructure / stateful adapters: modules that compose subsystems, wrap the `@inspector/core` **runtime**, or produce side effects. Examples: `environmentFactory`, `remoteOAuthStorage`, `oauthResume` (sessionStorage), `browserTabVisibility` (DOM listeners), `clearServerOAuthState`, `downloadFile`, `authToken` (`window.location` + `sessionStorage`), `protocolReplay` (re-issues through the live client).

The top-level `src/types/` is a separate sibling — ambient `.d.ts` module stubs, not the place for new domain types (the one that lingers there, dead `navigation.ts`, is tracked for removal in [#1785](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/1785)).

Nothing _enforces_ the boundary — no path alias keys off it, and the coverage `include` in `vite.config.ts` lists both directories, so a move between them is coverage-neutral. It's a human-legible import-time signal. See [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) for the full rule (including the whitelist caveat — a module placed outside `components`/`lib`/`utils`/`server` falls out of the ≥90 gate).

## Core tab automation contract

The Tools, Resources, and Prompts screens each expose a `data-testid` plus a
small set of `data-*` attributes, so a headless driver can `waitForSelector` on
a deterministic signal rather than on visible copy. `scripts/smoke-web-tabs.mjs`
drives all three against `test-servers/configs/web-tabs-http.json` ([#2148](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/2148)).
Treat them as a public contract, for the same reason as the Apps ones below:

| Attribute                            | Where              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-testid="tools-screen"`         | Tools screen root  | The element carrying the two attributes below.                                                                                                              |
| `data-tool-count`                    | on `tools-screen`  | How many tools the list holds. `0` is a *populated screen with an empty list* — distinct from the screen being absent, which is what a driver waits out.     |
| `data-call-status`                   | on `tools-screen`  | `idle` → `pending` → `ok` / `error` for the current `tools/call`. Always a value; an absent call state reads `idle`, never empty.                            |
| `data-testid="structured-output"`    | result panel       | The `structuredContent` section of a tool result ([#1908](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/1908)). Absent when a result carries none. |
| `data-testid="resources-screen"`     | Resources root     | The element carrying the three attributes below.                                                                                                            |
| `data-resource-count`                | on `resources-screen` | Entries from `resources/list`.                                                                                                                           |
| `data-template-count`                | on `resources-screen` | Entries from `resources/templates/list` — a **separate** call that can fail on its own, so it is reported separately.                                     |
| `data-read-status`                   | on `resources-screen` | `idle` → `pending` → `ok` / `error` for the current `resources/read`.                                                                                     |
| `data-testid="prompts-screen"`       | Prompts root       | The element carrying the two attributes below.                                                                                                              |
| `data-prompt-count`                  | on `prompts-screen`| Entries from `prompts/list`.                                                                                                                                |
| `data-get-status`                    | on `prompts-screen`| `idle` → `pending` → `ok` / `error` for the current `prompts/get`.                                                                                          |

Why attributes rather than text: a smoke that waited on a label fails the next
time the label is reworded, which is noise rather than signal — and it fails as
an opaque timeout, because there is nothing to compare against. The screen tests
pin each attribute name for the same reason: a rename should fail loudly in a
unit test, not silently in a five-minute gate.

## MCP Apps screen automation contract

The Apps screen exposes a small, stable set of `data-testid` / `data-*` attributes so an automated driver (deep-link auto-open, CI review harness) can `waitForSelector` on a deterministic signal instead of sleeping. Treat these as a public contract — drivers depend on them staying stable:

| Attribute                     | Where                | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `data-testid="apps-form"`     | Apps content card    | The container that carries the status/error attributes below.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `data-app-status`             | on `apps-form`       | Renderer lifecycle: `idle` (nothing running) → `loading` (bridge building / `ui/initialize` in flight) → `ready` (view fired `notifications/initialized`) → `error` (bridge factory threw/rejected). Poll for `ready`. |
| `data-app-error`              | on `apps-form`       | The failure reason string when `data-app-status="error"` (e.g. no connected client); absent otherwise.                                                                                                                 |
| `data-testid="apps-error"`    | error panel          | Rendered below the frame when the app fails to load (factory throw/reject); shows the reason so the failure isn't a silent blank frame.                                                                                |
| `data-testid="open-app"`      | Open App button      | Launches the selected app.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `data-testid="apps-stage"`    | Stage-partial button | Snapshots the current form values for progressive-render testing.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `data-testid="apps-messages"` | messages panel       | `ui/message` submissions from the running view.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `data-testid="apps-logs"`     | app-logs panel       | `notifications/message` log entries (default-expanded).                                                                                                                                                                |

App-rendered **elicitations** (#1854) render through the same `AppRenderer` but outside the Apps screen — one modal per request, from `AppElicitationHost` — and carry their own pair:

| Attribute                       | Where                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `data-testid="app-elicitation"` | the elicitation modal | One per in-flight app-rendered elicitation. **Absent** means the request was answered by the native elicitation form instead, which is what a driver asserts to prove the negotiation gate held. |
| `data-app-elicitation-status`   | on `app-elicitation`  | The same `AppRendererStatus` for that modal's app. `ready` is when the host forwards the `elicitation/create` through its bridge.                                                                |

`scripts/smoke-web-elicitation.mjs` drives both halves against the public fixture (`test-servers/configs/app-elicitation-http.json` and its `-native-` sibling).

The renderer lifecycle itself is `AppRendererStatus` (`loading` | `ready` | `error`) reported via `AppRenderer`'s `onAppStatusChange`; the screen maps it to `data-app-status`. Resource-read failures (malformed/404 UI resource) are surfaced as a toast via the bridge factory's `onResourceError`; because the app never reaches `ready` in that case, a driver times out on `data-app-status` and reads the toast.

## Deep-link auto-connect

A driver (launcher, CLI `--print-handoff`, CI review harness) can reach a **connected** inspector with a single navigate by encoding the target in the URL query string. Parsing + security gating live in `src/utils/deepLink.ts` (`parseDeepLink`), and a returned `DeepLink` is proof the link passed validation.

```
http://127.0.0.1:6274/?serverUrl=<url>&transport=http|sse&autoConnect=<token>
```

| Param         | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `serverUrl`   | The MCP server URL. Restricted to `http:` / `https:` (a crafted `javascript:` / `data:` / `file:` value is rejected). Canonicalized via `URL.href` so it matches the OAuth store's key form.                                                                                                                                 |
| `transport`   | `http` (streamable-HTTP, the default) or `sse`. Unknown values fall back to `http`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `autoConnect` | **CSRF gate.** Must equal the per-launch `MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN`. The token is random per launch and only known to whatever started the server, so a third-party-minted link cannot satisfy it — this is the same exposure surface as the existing `?MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN=` param. Without a match the link is ignored. |

The deep link upserts a stable `deep-link` catalog row (so a reload reconnects to the same row instead of accumulating duplicates) and connects. Connection-level outcomes are surfaced on the `AppShell.Header` as a machine-readable contract, so a driver can `waitForSelector` and read the failure reason without scraping a transient toast:

### Landing on a rendered app

Three further params extend the deep link to pre-select — and optionally auto-open — an MCP App, so a driver reaches a rendered widget with zero clicks:

```
…&openApp=<toolName>&appArgs=<base64url(JSON)>&autoOpen=<token>
```

| Param      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| `openApp`  | The app-tool name. Once the connection is up and the tool appears in the app list, the inspector switches to the Apps tab and pre-selects it.                                                                                                                |
| `appArgs`  | `base64url(JSON)` object of form values. Merged **over** the tool's schema defaults (`collectSchemaDefaults`) so a required-with-default field isn't left blank — which would otherwise disable "Open App". Malformed / non-object values fall back to `{}`. |
| `autoOpen` | **Same CSRF gate as `autoConnect`** — must equal the session token. When set, "Open App" fires automatically (a tool call from a URL), so the token gate is mandatory. Without a match the app is pre-selected but not opened.                               |

The app-side render lifecycle is observable through the [MCP Apps screen automation contract](#mcp-apps-screen-automation-contract) above (`data-app-status="ready"`), so a driver can `waitForSelector` the whole `connect → open → ready` chain deterministically.

## MCP App dedicated origins (`_meta.ui.domain`)

By default an MCP App is rendered by handing its HTML to the sandbox proxy as
`srcdoc`, inside an iframe sandboxed **without** `allow-same-origin`. That is
the isolation model from #1565 and it stays the default — but it gives the app
document an *opaque* origin, so every request it makes carries `Origin: null`.
An app whose backend allowlists origins (CORS, an OAuth callback, an API-key
allowlist) can't work that way, which is what the spec's `_meta.ui.domain`
exists to solve: a server uses it to ask its host for a stable, dedicated
origin.

**The Inspector's host-specific contract.** The spec makes `domain`'s format
host-dependent ("servers MUST consult host-specific documentation"), and the
Inspector owns no domain infrastructure — it cannot serve
`my-app.example.com`. So it treats the field as a **request, not an address**:

- Any **non-empty** `domain` string opts the resource in. The value itself is
  not parsed, matched, or reserved — declare whatever your production host
  expects.
- The Inspector answers with a real HTTP origin on loopback:
  `http://<host>:<MCP_APP_ORIGIN_PORT>`, default **`6278`** — in the same
  `627x` family as the web port `6274` and the sandbox port `6275`, so the
  three forward together. It is **not** `6276`: that is the fixed loopback
  OAuth callback the CLI and TUI listen on, which OAuth apps pre-register and
  which therefore cannot move. `6277` is skipped as v1's retired proxy port.
- The app document is served from there under an unguessable path, its
  per-app CSP delivered as a real response **header** (stronger than the
  `<meta>` the `srcdoc` path relies on) plus a `frame-ancestors` that admits
  only the two origins in its real ancestor chain — the sandbox proxy that
  frames it, **and** the Inspector page that frames the proxy. Both are
  required, not belt-and-braces: `frame-ancestors` is checked against every
  ancestor, so omitting the Inspector's own origin blocks the frame outright
  (see `appDocumentEmbedders`).
- The inner iframe is granted `allow-same-origin` on this path **only** —
  that is what makes the origin real rather than opaque. It is not a
  weakening of #1565: the listener is on its own port, so the app is
  cross-origin to both the sandbox proxy and the Inspector, and same-origin
  policy blocks the reach either way. The proxy refuses the grant outright if
  the URL's origin equals its own, and the grant is never reachable from the
  server-supplied `sandbox` string, which is still stripped.

**It is one shared origin, not one per app.** Every domain-declaring app is
served from the same port, keyed by path. That delivers the property the field
is *for* — a real, allowlistable origin — without minting a port or a DNS name
per app, at the cost of not being a per-app isolation boundary: two such apps
share `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and cookies for that origin.

**And the separate port does not isolate cookies from the rest of loopback.**
A distinct port makes a distinct *origin*, so the origin-scoped surfaces —
DOM/scripting access, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, IndexedDB — are isolated
from the sandbox proxy and from the Inspector page. **Cookies are not
origin-scoped**: they are keyed by host and path, ignoring port. An app served
here therefore shares the `127.0.0.1` cookie jar with the Inspector on `6274`
and with anything else on loopback — it can read any non-`HttpOnly` cookie set
for that host, and set `Path=/` cookies those services will receive.

This is not a hole in the Inspector's own auth: the API token travels in the
`x-mcp-remote-auth` header and lives in a `window` global and `sessionStorage`,
neither of which another origin can read. Closing the cookie gap properly needs
a distinct *host*, which this listener cannot mint (the Inspector owns no DNS,
and a second loopback address is not portable) — so it is stated rather than
papered over. Don't run the Inspector beside a loopback service whose session
cookie you would not hand to an app under test.

**Every failure falls back rather than blanking the app.** No app-origin
listener, a port that never bound, an older backend with no
`POST /api/app-document` route, a network error — each renders the app the
default (opaque-origin) way and logs a console warning naming `_meta.ui.domain`.
Losing the real origin degrades what the app can reach; losing the app itself
would be worse.

**One failure is outside that guarantee, deliberately: a published document the
browser cannot reach.** Every case above is one the *host* observes — publishing
returned nothing, so it falls back before choosing a render path. If publishing
succeeds and the browser then cannot load the URL (the port is not forwarded, or
a collision moved the listener to a dynamic port that is not), the frame stays
blank instead. There is no honest signal to fall back on: the navigation is
cross-origin, so `onerror` never fires for an HTTP error, `onload` fires for the
error page too, and nothing about the document is readable. The alternatives are
a timeout — which races an app that is merely slow, and "recovers" it by
re-running it at an opaque origin, executing its side effects twice — or a
reachability probe on every render, which proves the port answers rather than
that this fetch will. So the cause is removed instead of guessed at: every
documented remote workflow forwards the port (see below, the Docker section of
the root README, and the SSH recipe in `docs/mcp-app-review.md`).

**Forward `6278` too** if you need this off loopback (a container, a tunnel).
As with the sandbox port, a taken port falls back to an OS-assigned one with a
loud warning — the app still renders, but the origin an app's backend was told
to allowlist is then wrong, which is what the warning tells you.

## Theme (`src/theme/`)

Each customized Mantine component has a `Theme<Name>.ts` file (`Button.ts`, `Text.ts`, …, ~21 total) exporting a `Theme<Name>` constant; the barrel `index.ts` re-exports them and `theme.ts` assembles the `MantineProvider` theme. Theme files hold app-wide defaults and **variants** (flat CSS-in-JS); only pseudo-selectors, nested child selectors, keyframes, and native-HTML styling belong in `App.css`. Element components import from `@mantine/core` (never from `theme/`) — the theme layer is applied transparently by the provider.

**`cssVariables.ts` is the third piece, beside the component files and `App.css`.** It holds overrides for the CSS variables `MantineProvider` injects at runtime, which `App.css` cannot reach: the provider appends its generated `<style>` after the stylesheet imports, so a `:root` rule there loses on source order at equal specificity. `cssVariablesResolver` is the supported seam. It is passed at **all three** `MantineProvider` sites — the app (`main.tsx`), the Storybook preview, and `renderWithMantine` — so the running app, the stories, and the tests cannot disagree about a token's value. It currently corrects `--mantine-color-error`, whose Mantine defaults fail WCAG AA in both schemes at the size input error text renders.

## Code editing (`JsonObjectInput`)

Payloads whose _values_ may be arbitrary JSON — `_meta` is the case that forced it ([#1910](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/1910)) — are edited with **Ace** (`react-ace` + `ace-builds`, declared in this client because they render React) rather than the key/value rows used for headers and env, which cannot express an object value. Ace brings code folding, brace auto-closing, and per-line error annotation from its JSON worker.

Three integration details are load-bearing:

- **The worker is imported as `?url`** so Vite emits it as an asset. Without it Ace fetches `worker-json.js` from a path that does not exist in a bundled app and silently loses its annotations.
- **The gutter's colors are overridden in `App.css`**, keyed off Ace's cssClass (`ace-github` / `ace-github-dark` — _not_ the `theme-github_dark` module name). Ace's own themes are 1.89:1 and 4.13:1 there, both under AA, and folding needs the gutter so it cannot simply be hidden.
- **The label and error are wired to Ace's hidden textarea by hand.** `Input.Wrapper` associates a _Mantine_ input through context; Ace renders its own DOM, so the id, `aria-invalid` and `aria-describedby` are set on the textarea in an effect.

**Testing it is split by necessity.** Ace's input path does not work under happy-dom — `userEvent.type` reaches the textarea and produces no edit — so a keyboard test in the unit project passes while asserting nothing. Unit tests drive the editor instance through `src/test/aceEditor.ts`; real keyboard behaviour lives in the Storybook play functions, which run in Chromium.

## Testing

Tests run under three Vitest **projects** (configured in `vite.config.ts`), each in the right environment:

| Project       | Env           | Scope                                                                                                  | Script                     |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| `unit`        | happy-dom     | Components, hooks, utils (`*.test.tsx` beside the source)                                              | `npm test`                 |
| `integration` | node          | `@inspector/core` + transports + auth, spawning the real stdio test server (`src/test/integration/**`) | `npm run test:integration` |
| `storybook`   | real Chromium | Story **play functions** as interaction tests                                                          | `npm run test:storybook`   |

- `npm test` runs the fast **unit** project (happy-dom). `test:watch` for the loop.
- **Integration** tests run in a real Node env (no happy-dom, 30s timeouts) and spawn `test-servers/build/test-server-stdio.js` as a subprocess, so `pretest`/the coverage script build the test servers first (`test-servers:build`).
- **`npm run test:coverage`** runs unit **and** integration under v8 instrumentation and enforces the **per-file ≥90%** gate (lines/statements/functions/branches) — the same gate CI runs. Genuinely-unreachable branches are annotated with a justified `/* v8 ignore … */`, not waved through.

Integration tests live under `src/test/integration/` mirroring the `core/` layout; anything placed there is picked up by the `integration` project automatically. Render components with `renderWithMantine` (`src/test/renderWithMantine.tsx`) so they get the project theme.

## Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook        # dev server on :6006
npm run build:storybook  # static build
npm run test:storybook   # run every story's play function in headless Chromium
```

Storybook is first-class here because the components are presentational — each renders against fixture props. **Play functions double as interaction tests** and run headless in real Chromium via `@vitest/browser-playwright` + `@storybook/addon-vitest` (the `storybook` Vitest project). They're part of `npm run ci` (which installs the Chromium binary first) but kept out of the fast `validate` loop since they need the browser.

## Auth token

The dev/prod backend guards every `/api/*` route with `x-mcp-remote-auth: Bearer <MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN>`. The browser recovers the token, in priority order (see `App.tsx` `getAuthToken()`): the `window.__INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN__` global injected into `index.html` on every page load (`server/inject-auth-token.ts`), then a `?MCP_INSPECTOR_API_TOKEN=…` query param, then `sessionStorage`. Injection is a no-op when auth is disabled (`DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH`). See the root [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) for the full rationale.

## Host binding & the origin allow-list

Both the prod backend (`server/web-server-config.ts`) and the dev Vite server (`vite.config.ts`) resolve their bind host through one shared guard, `server/resolve-bind-host.ts`. It binds **`127.0.0.1`** by default and **refuses an all-interfaces host** (`0.0.0.0`, `::`, empty, or any equivalent spelling — `0`, `0x0`, `0.0`, `::0`, `::ffff:0.0.0.0`, … are all folded to the wildcard and refused) — which would expose the process-spawning backend to the whole network, the exposure DNS-rebinding attacks target — unless `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES=true` is set. The Docker image sets that flag (a container must bind `0.0.0.0` to be reachable through `-p`); a bare `HOST=0.0.0.0` anywhere else exits with an actionable error.

**The default is the IPv4 loopback _address_, deliberately not the name `localhost`** (#1951). `server.listen(port, host)` resolves a name through `dns.lookup` and binds the **single** address it gets back; since Node 17 the default result order is `verbatim`, so on a glibc Linux host — whose `/etc/hosts` maps `localhost` to both `127.0.0.1` and `::1` — that first address is `::1`. `HOST=localhost` there binds IPv6 loopback **only** and refuses every IPv4 client. On a desktop this is invisible (the browser resolves `localhost` the same way and lands on `::1` too); it breaks wherever the connection is made by something that pins `127.0.0.1` — a VS Code dev container's port forwarder, `ssh -L 6274:127.0.0.1:6274`, a container healthcheck. Binding the address takes the resolver out of the decision. Browsing to `http://localhost:PORT` still works, since browsers fall back across address families and the loopback allow-list covers all three forms. An explicit `HOST=localhost` is still honored as typed — the single-family bind is then your choice.

The backend's `/api/*` routes also enforce an **origin allow-list** (`allowedOrigins`) as DNS-rebinding protection. When left to default on a loopback host, it expands to all three interchangeable loopback origin forms for the port — `http://localhost:PORT`, `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, and `http://[::1]:PORT` — because `localhost` resolves to either IPv4 or IPv6 loopback and Node/Vite may bind the IPv6 form, so the browser can legitimately arrive at `http://[::1]:PORT`. Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated) to override; entries are canonicalized (`new URL(o).origin`), so a trailing slash / uppercase host / explicit `:80` still match. **Each entry must include the scheme** — `http://localhost:6274`, not `localhost:6274` (a scheme-less value is dropped with a warning). `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` **replaces** the default list (it does not merge), so **list every origin you'll browse from, including the loopback forms** you still want (`http://localhost:PORT`, `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, `http://[::1]:PORT`) — otherwise local access stops working. A blank `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` does **not** disable the check — it falls back to the default (fail closed); there is no env knob to turn origin validation off.

### Hosting on a network

The guard blocks only the **wildcard** all-interfaces addresses. Binding a **specific** IP or hostname is allowed with no opt-in — that's a single, deliberate exposure, unlike the wildcard which binds every interface at once (the pattern DNS-rebinding exploits). To serve the Inspector on a LAN or the internet:

- **Bind a specific address.** `HOST=192.168.1.50` (a LAN IP) or a public IP works directly: the default origin allow-list follows the bind host, so `allowedOrigins` becomes `http://<that-host>:PORT` and a browser hitting that address is accepted with no extra config. (The host is canonicalized the way a browser is — so `HOST=127.1` advertises `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`, an IPv6 bind host is bracketed as `http://[2001:db8::1]:PORT`, and the port is dropped when it's the http default `:80` — matching what the browser sends.)
- **Behind TLS or a reverse proxy**, the browser's `Origin` becomes the public origin (e.g. `https://inspector.example.com`, often without a port), which won't match the auto-derived `http://<bind-host>:PORT`. Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to the real public origin(s): `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://inspector.example.com`.
- **Using the `0.0.0.0` wildcard** (opt-in via `DANGEROUSLY_BIND_ALL_INTERFACES=true`, as the Docker image does): a wildcard bind also serves loopback, so the default allow-list is the loopback trio plus the canonical wildcard origins (`http://0.0.0.0:PORT`, `http://[::]:PORT`), and **local access works out of the box** — `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:6274:6274` browsed at `http://localhost:6274` connects with no extra config. Reaching it at a **non-loopback** address (a LAN IP, a public hostname) still needs `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` — but since that **replaces** the default, keep the loopback forms in the list if you also browse locally: `ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:PORT,http://127.0.0.1:PORT,http://192.168.1.50:PORT,https://inspector.example.com`.

The bind-host guard and the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` allow-list apply to both the prod server and `--dev`. Note that in **`--dev`** the Vite dev server _additionally_ enforces its own `server.allowedHosts` Host-header check, whose default accepts loopback and IP-literal hosts. The host you **bind** is auto-allowed (Vite adds the resolved `server.host` — which this config sets from `HOST` — to the allow-list), so `HOST=<hostname>` works out of the box under `--dev` too. What needs an explicit `server.allowedHosts` entry is reaching the dev server at a **different** name than the one bound — e.g. a wildcard bind reached by hostname, or a reverse-proxy domain. For those, prefer the prod server (`mcp-inspector --web`) or add the host to `server.allowedHosts`.

**MCP Apps caveats.** The MCP Apps sandbox runs on a **separate** port — `MCP_SANDBOX_PORT`, defaulting to a fixed **`6275`** (#2008; it was OS-assigned before, which meant it changed every run and so could never be named in a `forwardPorts` / `-p` / tunnel config written ahead of time). For the Apps tab to work off loopback, that sandbox port must be independently reachable from the browser — expose/forward `6275` alongside `6274`, or set `MCP_SANDBOX_PORT` to pick another. If the port is already taken the sandbox falls back to an OS-assigned one and warns, so a second Inspector still gets a working Apps tab locally — but the forwarded port is then wrong, which is what the warning tells you. (Under a `0.0.0.0` wildcard bind the sandbox URL is advertised as `localhost`, which is reachable — a wildcard bind serves loopback — so only the port needs handling.) Also note the sandbox iframe is gated by a `frame-ancestors` CSP, and **a bracketed IPv6 literal is not a valid CSP host-source** — so MCP Apps requires browsing the app at a name or IPv4 (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, a hostname, a LAN IPv4), **not** a bare `http://[::1]:…` address. Finally, the sandbox URL is always `http://` — so **behind TLS** (an `https://` app page) the browser blocks the `http://…/sandbox` iframe as mixed content and MCP Apps can't render; the Apps tab needs a plain-`http` app origin today.

In every case, exposing the Inspector beyond loopback also means anyone who can reach it can drive its backend — keep authentication on (do **not** set `DANGEROUSLY_OMIT_AUTH`) and prefer a specific bind address over the wildcard.

## HTTP proxy support

The web backend connects to remote MCP servers through the shared Node fetch (`core/mcp/node/proxyFetch.ts`), which honors the conventional proxy environment variables: `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` (and their lowercase forms) select the proxy, and `NO_PROXY` exempts hosts. Routing uses [`undici`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/undici)'s own `fetch` bound to its `EnvHttpProxyAgent`, imported lazily only when a proxy variable is set, so runs without a proxy configured pay no cost.

The proxy sits at the **bottom** of the fetch stack rather than wrapping the transport's fetch, and both undici halves must come from the same copy — see [HTTP proxy support](../cli/README.md#http-proxy-support) in the CLI README for why ([#2067](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/2067)).
