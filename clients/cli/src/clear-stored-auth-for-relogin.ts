 * deleting it locally without revoking is the leak this whole change closes.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no** cross-key deduplication. It looked cheap — the
 * two keys are usually two spellings of one server — but it can only be done by
 * pre-reading a single token, and a plan enumerates every issuer slot under a
 * key. So a shared *active* token would have skipped the second key entirely,
 * taking any additional issuer-bound grant under it with the local delete. A
 * duplicate RFC 7009 request is harmless (§2.2 makes an unknown token a
 * success), which is a much better trade than a missed one.
 *
 * One budget across both plans, for the same reason a plan shares one across
 * its grants: two keys would otherwise double the wait.
 *
 * Reporting prefers a **failure** over any success — a grant still live at the
 * authorization server is what the user needs to hear about, and a success
 * would otherwise silence the warning. Failing that it is the first plan's
 * outcome that was not "nothing to do", which with the keys in
 * `findStoredServerState` precedence means the grant the CLI would actually
 * have connected with. When no key held a token, the last "nothing to do"
 * answer is returned so the caller can still tell "no tokens" from "this
 * authorization server advertises no revocation endpoint".
