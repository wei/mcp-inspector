/**
 * Flattening of the JSON Schema **composition** keywords that a tool's
 * `inputSchema` may carry at its **root** — `allOf`, and a top-level `anyOf` /
 * `oneOf` union — into the plain object schema a form renderer can build fields
 * from.
 *
 * Both form builders — the web client's `SchemaForm` and the TUI's
 * `schemaToForm` — enumerate the root schema's `properties` and nothing else.
 * A schema that keeps its fields on composition branches therefore rendered
 * **no controls at all**: not a branch picker, not even the raw-JSON fallback a
 * union-typed *property* already gets, so the tool could only ever be called
 * with empty arguments (#2123). The 2026-07-28 revision makes such a schema
 * explicitly legal — `type: "object"` is required at the root, and "any JSON
 * Schema 2020-12 keyword may appear alongside `type`, including composition
 * keywords".
 *
 * Shared for the same reason {@link ./nullableUnion.ts} is: the two clients
 * would otherwise grow separate answers to "which schemas can I render", and
 * the CLI's argument coercion (`convertToolParameters`) needs the same view of
 * where a property's schema lives.
 *
 * Deliberately **not** a JSON Schema evaluator. It rewrites nothing it cannot
 * do faithfully: `not`, and branches that are not object schemas, are left
 * alone rather than guessed at (see {@link resolveRootUnion}).
