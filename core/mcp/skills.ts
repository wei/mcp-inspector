/**
 * Skills extension (SEP-2640) detection, conformance checking, and digest
 * verification — the part of the extension that makes the Inspector more than a
 * viewer.
 *
 * SEP-2640 puts real obligations on whoever consumes a skill: verify each
 * fetched file against the digest its manifest advertised, treat a mismatch as
 * a failure, and honor the per-skill limits. Every one of those is a check a
 * server author wants run against their implementation, which is the same
 * argument the CLI's `--strict` tool-schema lint makes. So the checks live here,
 * shared by every client, and produce a structured finding list rather than a
 * boolean — a report is useful, "invalid" is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ Skills is negotiated from **both** sides (SEP-2133), and the two halves
 * live in different places. This module reads the *server's* declaration off
 * the connecting server's `capabilities.extensions` — that is what gates the
 * Skills screen. The *Inspector's* own declaration is a separate entry in
 * `ADVERTISABLE_EXTENSIONS` (`core/mcp/extensions.ts`): a strict server refuses
 * `skills/*` to a client that did not declare it, and turning that toggle off
 * in Server Settings is how to check a server's refusal path (#2373). An
 * earlier revision of this comment said Skills must never be in that registry;
 * that was the missing client declaration #2373 fixed.
 *
 * The Inspector is an inspector, not a host: a `resources/read` of a `SKILL.md`
 * is explicitly not a load and confers no standing, so none of the SEP's host
 * machinery (activation, per-skill consent, content-bound approval) is
 * implemented here. Surface and verify.
 *
 * **The frontmatter cross-check closes the gap the digest cannot** (#2248).
 * SEP-2640 requires that an entry's `frontmatter` match the fetched `SKILL.md`'s
 * frontmatter field by field, and no digest can establish that: a digest is
 * taken over the bytes the server served, so it proves the file was not altered
 * in transit and says nothing about whether the *listing* described that file
 * honestly. A server could advertise one description, serve another, and pass
 * every other check in this module. {@link checkSkillFrontmatterMatch} is the
 * check; it needs a real YAML parser, and `core/mcp/skillFile.ts` explains why
 * that dependency is imported rather than approximated.

 * A skill URI in normalized form, or `undefined` when it is not one.

 * Two things a raw string comparison gets wrong, and both matter:
 *
 * 1. **`..` segments.** `skill://acme/billing/refunds/../other.md` starts with
 *    the advertised root but resolves outside it. Containment has to be decided
 *    on the resolved path, so every check below goes through the parser.
 * 2. **Relative strings.** SEP-2640 requires a full resource URI, and
 *    `demo/SKILL.md` is not one — it fails to parse and is reported as
 *    `malformed-uri` rather than quietly treated as a skill path.
 *
 * An **opaque-path** URI (`skill:demo/SKILL.md`, no authority) parses but is
 * NOT normalized by the parser — its `..` segments survive verbatim — so it is
 * rejected too: containment could not be decided on it, and silently accepting
 * one would reintroduce exactly the hole this function closes.
 *
 * A **path-less authority** URI (`skill://data-analysis`) is accepted, and is
 * not the opaque case above: RFC 3986 gives a URI with an authority an empty
 * path, and the parser reports that as `pathname === ""`. The authority has to
 * be non-empty — `skill:` parses to an empty path too, with no host. It has no segments,
 * so nothing survives unnormalized. It is what a skill's root directory looks
 * like once `/SKILL.md` is removed, so rejecting it made a server echoing that
 * root back in a directory read read as "outside this skill" when it is the
 * skill itself (#2295). It names no file, so it still fails every check that
 * needs one — `skillNameFromUri` wants the `/SKILL.md` suffix, and a manifest
 * entry spelled this way does not start with `<root>/`.
 *
 * The scheme is deliberately **not** constrained. `skill://` is what SEP-2640
 * recommends and what this repo's fixture serves, but the SEP only says servers
 * SHOULD use it and explicitly allows a domain-native scheme (`github://…`), so
 * requiring `skill:` would hand a conforming server a false `malformed-uri` and
 * skip its name and root checks entirely. Containment is scheme-independent
 * anyway: it compares a resource against *this entry's own* root, so an entry
 * cannot escape its skill whatever scheme it uses.
