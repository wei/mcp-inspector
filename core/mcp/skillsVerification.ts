/**
 * Fetch-and-verify: run every SEP-2640 check that needs the *bytes* of a skill's
 * files, over a whole set of entries (#2248).
 *
 * Separate from `skills.ts`, which is deliberately I/O-free —
 * `checkSkillConformance` reads a manifest, `verifySkillResource` compares bytes
 * it is handed, `checkSkillFrontmatterMatch` compares text it is handed, and
 * none of them knows how to obtain a file. This module is the part that does,
 * and keeping it in its own file is what lets the pure checks stay testable with
 * no client at all.
 *
 * It lives in `core/` because **two** clients drive it: the CLI's `--verify`
 * turns it into an NDJSON report with an exit code, and the TUI's Skills pane
 * runs it for one selected skill. Only the web screen does something different
 * — it fetches lazily, per click, because a browser user is reading one file at
 * a time rather than asking a yes/no question about a catalog. That difference
 * is about *when* to fetch, not *how* to check, so it does not belong here.
 *
 * ⚠️ Reads are **sequential, deliberately.** A conforming manifest may declare
 * 512 entries, and a parallel walk over one would open 512 `resources/read`
 * calls against a server whose whole purpose here is to be tested — the hazard
 * the web screen bounds with a concurrency limit. Sequential also makes the
 * report deterministic: entries come back in manifest order on every run, so a
 * CI diff of two reports shows what changed rather than what raced.
