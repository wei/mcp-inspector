/**
 * Skills extension wire schemas — SEP-2640 (`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`).
 *
 * There is no `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-skills` package (404 on npm) and the
 * SDK's era codecs define none of these methods, so the Inspector drives them
 * as ordinary `client.request(…, ResultSchema)` calls with the explicit result
 * schemas below. That is exactly what the SDK prescribes for a consumer-owned
 * extension method: `Protocol._assertOutboundRequestInEra` only fires for names
 * one of the era codecs knows, so `skills/list` and `skills/get` are era-blind
 * and go out unchanged on both the 2025- and 2026-era legs. The raw-wire escape
 * hatch that modern `tasks/*` needs is deliberately NOT used here — `tasks/*`
 * are spec names the 2026 codec deleted, which is a different problem.
 *
 * **This module is the wire surface for the two methods the Inspector calls.**
 * SEP-2640 is Accepted, so the method names and the entry shape are settled;
 * the skill *format* is delegated to the independently-versioned Agent Skills
 * specification. Keeping every wire type here makes a spec revision a
 * single-file edit (#2234).
 *
 * **Permissive where a defect should be reported; strict where a shape is
 * settled.** `looseObject`, and a `digest` typed as a plain string rather than
 * a hex-constrained one, so a non-conforming server is *surfaced* by
 * `checkSkillConformance` rather than rejected at the parse — a malformed
 * digest is a finding, not a parse error to swallow. But a settled shape is
 * enforced, because silently normalizing one past the checks would defeat the
 * point: `skills/get` requires its `{ skill }` envelope, and a modern
 * `skills/list` result requires the base list envelope (see
 * `ModernListSkillsResultSchema`).

 * and later, the result also carries … `ttlMs` and `cacheScope`."* The field
 * shapes mirror `ModernResultEnvelopeSchema` in `listSalvage.ts`, which is this
 * repo's existing statement of a modern result envelope and is already applied
 * to modern list results on the salvage path — so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * The era split is load-bearing rather than defensive. `skills/*` is a
 * consumer-owned method, so it is absent from the SDK's cacheable-method
 * registry and **nothing else validates this**: without an era-aware schema a
 * modern server could answer `{ skills: [] }` and the conformance UI would
 * present it as a clean list. The legacy shape stays permissive because these
 * are 2026-era attributes a legacy server has no business sending.
 *
 * ⚠️ Picked by `InspectorClient.listSkills` from the negotiated era — a schema
 * cannot know it on its own.
 *
 * ⚠️ **No `resultType` member, and that is not an omission (#2373).** The
 * SDK's 2026-07-28 codec checks `resultType` on every result — missing is
 * `InvalidResult`, anything but `"complete"` is `UnsupportedResultType` — and
 * then **deletes it** before the result reaches the caller's schema. Requiring
 * it here therefore rejected every conforming modern page, and did so unseen
 * only because the integration suite's "modern" cases were connecting on
 * legacy. The caching attributes are different: the codec neither checks nor
 * lifts them for a consumer-owned method, so this schema is still the only
 * thing that does.

 * the way {@link ModernListSkillsResultSchema} does. SEP-2640 forecloses it in
 * as many words, under `skills/get`: *"whether the result should also carry the
 * base protocol's caching attributes (`ttlMs` and `cacheScope`, per SEP-2549),
 * as `resources/read` results do, is **left open**"*.
 *
 * So there is no requirement to enforce, and inventing one would do real harm
 * rather than none: a server that reasonably reads "left open" as "not
 * required" would be reported as non-conforming by the tool whose job is to
 * tell it whether it conforms. `looseObject` means a server that *does* send
 * them still parses, which is the right handling for an attribute the spec
 * permits and does not mandate. Revisit only if a later revision closes the
 * question — and note that the same sentence is why `skills/get` carries no
 * `nextCursor` handling either: "a single entry is not a list".
 *
 * Required, not one of two accepted shapes. An earlier revision of this module
 * also accepted a bare entry at the top level, on the reading that the SEP
 * settled the entry but not its wrapper. It does settle the wrapper, and
 * accepting the inline form would silently normalize a non-conforming response
 * — which is exactly the failure this extension's support exists to *report*.
 * A server that returns the entry inline now fails the parse, loudly.

 *
 * ⚠️ It is **stricter than everything else in this module**, and that is the

 * whole page instead of being reported as a per-child finding — the opposite of
 * the posture the entry schemas above take. The reason the trade goes the other

 *  - For `resources/directory/read` it states **nothing of the kind**, and its
 *    one worked example carries `resultType: "complete"` and no caching
 *    attributes at all. Requiring them would fail a server that matched the
 *    SEP's own example, the failure direction this module works hardest to
 *    avoid.
 *  - For `skills/get` the SEP leaves the question open in as many words (see
 *    {@link GetSkillEnvelopeSchema}).
 *
 * So both eras parse those two results with one schema each. An earlier
 * revision required `resultType` on "modern" variants of both; since the codec
 * lifts it, they could never pass on a real modern connection.
