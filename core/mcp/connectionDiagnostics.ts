/**
 * Connection diagnostics: what the client is still waiting on, when it last
 * heard back, and the state of the server-to-client notification stream — and
 * the one place that turns the SDK's bare `Request timed out` into a message
 * that reports those facts (#2318).
 *
 * The motivating case is #2187: a server that serves one request at a time.
 * The standalone `GET /mcp` stream the client opens after `initialize`
 * occupies that single slot, so `initialize` succeeds and every request after
 * it hangs — and the Inspector's only word on it was `Request timed out`,
 * which names the symptom the user can already see. Every fact needed to
 * suspect the cause was already in-process at that moment: the stream had been
 * open for the whole session and delivered nothing, `tools/list` had been
 * outstanding for 60s, and nothing had been answered since `initialize`.
 *
 * Everything here is pure. `InspectorClient` owns the bookkeeping (it sees
 * every outbound request, every inbound response and every tracked fetch) and
 * hands a snapshot to {@link annotateRequestTimeout}; the UI clients render the
 * same snapshot through `getConnectionDiagnostics()`.
 *
 * Deliberately factual: the summary reports what the connection's state *is*
 * and lets the reader draw the conclusion. It does not assert a diagnosis the
 * Inspector cannot verify from its own side.
