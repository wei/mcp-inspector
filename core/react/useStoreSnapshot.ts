/**
 * Subscribe to one event on one state store and read a value from it (#1955).
 *
 * This replaces the `useState(read(prop)) + useEffect(re-read; subscribe)`
 * shape every list/log hook in this directory used to carry. That shape has
 * two defects, both invisible in the common case and both fixed here:
 *
 * 1. **A stale frame when the store prop changes.** Switching servers hands
 *    the hook a different store, but the effect that re-reads it runs *after*
 *    the render commits — so React paints one frame of the previous server's
 *    tools, then corrects itself. `useSyncExternalStore` reads during render,
 *    so the swap lands in the same frame.
 * 2. **A missed update between render and subscribe.** An event dispatched in
 *    that gap was lost, because the snapshot was taken before the listener
 *    was attached. React re-checks the snapshot immediately after subscribing,
 *    which closes the window — provided the snapshot is read from the live
 *    store rather than from something the (not-yet-attached) listener would
 *    have had to invalidate. That is why the cache below keys off the store's
 *    own dispatch counter and not off a dirty flag set by our listener.
 *
 * It is the same reasoning `useListError` documents; that hook needs no cache
 * because its snapshot is the stored `Error` instance itself.
 *
 * ## Why a revision counter
 *
 * `useSyncExternalStore` requires `getSnapshot` to return a referentially
 * stable value across reads that mean "no change" — otherwise every read looks
 * like a new value and React re-renders forever. These stores return a
 * defensive copy (`getTools()` is `[...this.items]`), so the raw getter cannot
 * be used directly. Caching against `getEventRevision(event)` gives an O(1)
 * check that is exact in both directions: unchanged revision returns the
 * identical value, and any dispatch produces a fresh one — including a
 * dispatch that mutated an entry *inside* the list, which a contents
 * comparison could not detect (see `TypedEventTarget.getEventRevision`).
 *
 * ## Caller contract
 *
 * `read` and `whenAbsent` must be module-scope constants, not values built in
 * the component body — every caller in this directory declares them beside the
 * hook.
 *
 * They are part of the cache key below, along with `event`, so that a changed
 * argument can never be answered with a value computed from the previous one.
 * The consequence is that passing a fresh closure (or a fresh `[]`) per render
 * defeats the cache entirely: each read returns a new defensive copy, and
 * React fails it outright with "The result of getSnapshot should be cached".
 * That is the intended failure mode. The alternative — keying only on the
 * store and its revision — would tolerate an unstable argument by silently
 * serving a stale value, and a loud error at first render beats a wrong list
 * nobody can account for.
 *
 * @param store       the state store, or `null` when no server is active
 * @param event       the store event that signals this value changed
 * @param read        reads the value out of a non-null store
 * @param whenAbsent  the value to report while `store` is `null`
