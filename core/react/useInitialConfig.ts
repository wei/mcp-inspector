/**
 * React hook over the `GET /api/config` endpoint — the single fetch of the
 * static `InitialConfigPayload` the dev/prod web backends serve alongside the
 * SPA (see `core/mcp/remote/node/server.ts`). It exposes the three fields the
 * web app reads off that payload:
 *
 * - `sandboxUrl` — the MCP Apps sandbox proxy URL. The backend mounts
 *   `sandbox_proxy.html` on a separate controller port and advertises the URL
 *   here; the Apps screen embeds it as the trusted outer iframe. `undefined`
 *   until the fetch resolves, and whenever the backend omits it (legacy backend,
 *   or a build without the sandbox controller) — callers treat that as "Apps
 *   unavailable" rather than a blank iframe.
 * - `writable` — whether the session's server list is a writable catalog or a
 *   read-only session (`--config` / ad-hoc `--server-url`). Defaults to `true`
 *   until the fetch resolves and whenever the field is absent (a legacy backend
 *   predating the flag), so the default catalog keeps full CRUD.
 * - `version` — the Inspector version the backend reads from the root
 *   `package.json` (the browser can't read it off disk). `undefined` until the
 *   fetch resolves, and whenever the backend omits it (legacy backend) — the UI
 *   renders nothing then.
 * - `secretStorage` — which store this session's secrets go to (#1950),
 *   resolved on the Node side where the keychain probe happens. `undefined`
 *   until the fetch resolves and on a backend that omits it; the settings-modal
 *   footers render nothing then, because a guessed answer under a secret field
 *   is worse than no answer.
 *
 * This consolidates the three former single-field hooks (`useSandboxUrl`,
 * `useServerListWritable`, `useInspectorVersion`), each of which fetched the
 * same static payload separately, into one request (#1643).
 *
 * Fetches on mount, and re-fetches if `baseUrl` or `authToken` changes (rare —
 * effectively a full reload; the GET is idempotent). A response that resolves
 * after unmount or a re-fetch is dropped rather than overwriting current state.
