/**
 * Compatibility shim for a plain OAuth 2.0 authorization server that publishes
 * its RFC 8414 metadata at the OpenID Connect well-known path (#2172).
 *
 * ## The upstream defect
 *
 * Filed as modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#2733.
 *
 * `discoverAuthorizationServerMetadata` in `@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0`
 * tries a fixed list of well-known URLs (`buildDiscoveryUrls`) and picks the
 * validation schema from the **filename that resolved**, not from the document
 * that came back:
 *
 * ```js
 * const parsed = type === "oauth"
 *   ? OAuthMetadataSchema.parse(body)
 *   : OpenIdProviderDiscoveryMetadataSchema.parse(body);
 * ```
 *
 * `type` is `"oidc"` for every `openid-configuration` candidate, so a document
 * served there is required to carry `jwks_uri`, `subject_types_supported` and
 * `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` — three fields OpenID Connect
 * Discovery 1.0 requires and RFC 8414 does not. A plain OAuth 2.0 authorization
 * server — no ID tokens, no JWKS, no `sub` — that publishes at that path is
 * therefore rejected with a `ZodError`, and because the parse **throws** rather
 * than continuing the loop, discovery aborts outright: the connection fails and
 * no later candidate is tried.
 *
 * RFC 8414 §5 explicitly anticipates this deployment. `openid-configuration` is
 * a permitted location for general OAuth authorization server metadata, and the
 * OIDC-only fields are not part of the RFC 8414 document. So the server in
 * #2172 is conforming and the client is wrong.
 *
 * ## What this wrapper does
 *
 * It never fabricates a field. It changes *which candidate URL* the document is
 * handed back on, so the SDK validates it under the schema that actually
 * describes it:
 *
 * 1. It watches only for the RFC 8414 candidate,
 *    `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server[<path>]`, and only when that
 *    request came back with a status the SDK treats as "try the next
 *    candidate" (4xx, or 502).
 * 2. It then fetches the OIDC candidates the SDK would try next — derived from
 *    the request URL by the same rule `buildDiscoveryUrls` uses, which
 *    `oidcDiscoveryCandidates` mirrors and a test pins against the SDK's own
 *    exported function so the two cannot drift.
 * 3. If one of them returns a document that satisfies `OAuthMetadataSchema` but
 *    **fails** `OpenIdProviderDiscoveryMetadataSchema` — i.e. it is RFC 8414
 *    metadata and is not an OpenID provider document — that body is returned as
 *    the response to the RFC 8414 request. The SDK parses it with
 *    `OAuthMetadataSchema`, which is the correct schema for it, and discovery
 *    succeeds.
 *
 * A document that *does* satisfy the OIDC schema is left alone: the original
 * response is returned unchanged and the SDK proceeds to its own OIDC candidate
 * as usual. That costs one duplicate request on a genuine OIDC server, which is
 * the price of not changing behavior for the case that already works.
 *
 * ## What it deliberately does not do
 *
 * - **It does not weaken issuer validation.** The substituted document is the
 *   one the server actually published, `issuer` included, so the SDK's RFC 8414
 *   §3.3 issuer-echo check runs on it exactly as before. A document whose
 *   `issuer` does not match is still rejected.
 * - **It does not invent `jwks_uri` (or any other field).** Back-filling the
 *   three OIDC-required fields would also make the parse succeed, but the
 *   Inspector would then be displaying, in the Auth and Network tabs, a
 *   metadata document the server never published — which is the one thing a
 *   debugging tool must not do.
 * - **It does not present the substitution as the server's own answer.** It is
 *   installed on `InspectorClient`'s *base* fetch — below both fetch trackers,
 *   the same seam `withOAuthEndpointOverrides` uses — because that is the only
 *   place that also covers the discovery the SDK runs from **inside the
 *   transport**, which is handed the base fetch directly and whose tracker is
 *   built inside the transport where nothing here can reach above it
 *   (Copilot). One seam therefore covers every path, at the cost that a
 *   captured entry shows the substituted document rather than the real 404 —
 *   so the substituted response carries {@link COMPAT_SOURCE_HEADER} naming
 *   the URL the body actually came from, and the warning below says the same
 *   thing on the console. The probe itself is issued through the wrapped fetch
 *   and so is not separately tracked.
 *
 * ## Removing this
 *
 * This is a workaround for an upstream bug, not a feature. When
 * modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#2733 lands — the SDK selecting the schema
 * from the document rather than from the filename, or treating a schema failure
 * as a candidate to skip rather than as fatal — delete this module and its
 * wiring in `core/mcp/inspectorClient.ts`.
