/**
 * Which {@link SecretStore} this process uses, and how the user finds out
 * (#1950).
 *
 * ## The policy
 *
 * `MCP_INSPECTOR_SECRET_STORE=keyring|file|memory` wins outright. With it
 * unset:
 *
 * 1. Probe the OS keychain. Reachable → use it. This is the overwhelming
 *    majority of runs and nothing changes for them.
 * 2. Unreachable → fall back, **loudly**. Which way we fall back depends
 *    on whether the file we would write is going to survive:
 *    - in a container whose secrets directory is *not* on a mount →
 *      `memory`;
 *    - otherwise → `file`.
 *
 * ## Why automatic
 *
 * Automatic fallback silently changes where a secret lives, which is a
 * real objection to make of a security-adjacent tool. But the objection
 * is to *silently*, not to *automatic*: requiring an env var before any
 * persistence works at all means the container user's first encounter is
 * a 503 with no hint that a working configuration exists — and the store
 * they would then be told to set is the one this code would have picked
 * anyway. So we take the friendly default and pay for it in noise. The
 * downgrade prints a banner, rides `GET /api/config`, and is named in the
 * footer of both settings modals — permanently, where the secret is
 * typed, rather than once at startup where the person typing it 20
 * minutes later will never see it.
 *
 * ## Why memory can be the better answer
 *
 * A file in a container's writable layer looks like persistence and isn't:
 * `docker run --rm` discards it, and so does any image update. An
 * in-memory store makes no such promise, and says so. Mounting a volume —
 * which the README already recommends for the catalog — flips the same
 * run to `file` with no configuration, because the mount is the user
 * stating that this directory is meant to survive.
