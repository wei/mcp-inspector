/**
 * `@napi-rs/keyring` ships one prebuilt binary per platform triple, and
 * loading the package *throws* on a platform it has no binary for —
 * Android / Termux is the reported case (#1905), where the import fails
 * with "Cannot find native binding" / "Cannot find module
 * '@napi-rs/keyring-android-arm64'".
 *
 * A static top-level import made that a startup crash: the module never
 * evaluated, so the Inspector exited before any of the
 * keychain-unavailable handling below could run. Loading it lazily, and
 * caching the *outcome* rather than only the module, folds an
 * unsupported platform into the same degradation contract as an
 * unreachable keychain (see `KeyringSecretStore`) — the store is simply
 * unavailable, and callers see it through the documented behavior
 * instead of a crash.
 *
 * The failure is cached alongside the success so a box without a binary
 * doesn't re-attempt (and re-throw) the resolution on every secret
 * operation, and so `set` can name the underlying cause in its
 * `KeychainUnavailableError`.
 *
 * The cache is process-lifetime by design — there is no reset seam, since
 * a platform does not grow a native binary mid-run. Tests reach the
 * unloadable path through `vi.resetModules()` + `vi.doMock`, which gives
 * them a fresh module (and so a fresh cache) instead.
 *
 * A resolved import is also **shape-checked** before being accepted. The
 * package is CJS, so the named exports we rely on come from interop, and
 * a resolution that stopped yielding them (a default-only export in a
 * future version, a bundler changing interop, a platform where the
 * named-export detection fails) would land as `undefined`, making
 * `new mod.AsyncEntry(...)` throw `TypeError: not a constructor` from
 * inside the very `try` that implements graceful degradation.
 *
 * Be precise about what this buys, because it is narrower than it looks:
 * it does **not** stop a bad shape from emptying the secret list. `get`
 * returns `null` either way — that is its read-tolerance contract, and
 * the `TypeError` lands in the same `catch` that a dead keychain does.
 * What the check changes is *diagnosis*. Without it the only signal is
 * `set` reporting "keyring.mod.AsyncEntry is not a constructor", an
 * internal-looking message that reads like an Inspector bug; with it,
 * `set` names the actual problem once, at the load boundary, in the same
 * actionable 503 as every other flavor of unavailability. Detecting the
 * silent-empty-list case itself would take a real round-trip against the
 * unmocked package, which nothing in the suite does today.

 *    above defers and caches it instead.
 * 2. **The package loads but exposes the wrong shape** — the named
 *    exports arrive via CJS interop, so a resolution that stopped
 *    yielding them would hand us `undefined` and fail as a `TypeError`
 *    swallowed by the degradation path. `loadKeyring()` shape-checks up
 *    front so `set` can name that cause instead of surfacing an
 *    "is not a constructor" message (see the note there — the check
 *    improves the diagnosis, it does not change what `get` returns).
 * 3. **`AsyncEntry::new` throws** — it performs the platform-store setup
 *    (on Linux, the Secret Service connect with a keyutils fallback) and
 *    throws when no backend is reachable. Construction is therefore
 *    deliberately **inside** each method's `try`; outside it, the raw
 *    error escaped and 500'd every `GET /api/servers` before any secret
 *    was involved (#1848).
