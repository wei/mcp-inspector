/**
 * RFC 7009 OAuth 2.0 Token Revocation (#2144).
 *
 * Clearing the Inspector's OAuth state used to delete the *local* copy of the
 * tokens and stop there: the access token, and the refresh token when one was
 * issued, stayed valid at the authorization server until they expired on their
 * own. From the AS's side nothing happened — the client just went quiet — so a
 * day of connect/disconnect iteration left it holding a pile of live grants for
 * sessions that had ended hours ago. RFC 7009 §1 describes exactly this case
 * (a client invalidating its tokens when the user logs out or walks away) and
 * this module is the request that closes it.
 *
 * Everything here is **best-effort**, and deliberately so: the local clear is
 * what the user asked for, and it must finish whether or not the AS cooperates.
 * An authorization server that advertises no `revocation_endpoint` is left
 * behaving exactly as before, a network error or a non-2xx is reported and
 * swallowed, and a short timeout keeps a slow AS from hanging the teardown.
 * Every path therefore returns a {@link TokenRevocationOutcome} rather than
 * throwing — a caller is telling us to forget these tokens, and there is no
 * failure here that should stop it.
