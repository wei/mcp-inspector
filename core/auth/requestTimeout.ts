/**
 * A bound on every network call the Inspector makes on the OAuth path (#2319).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * Protected-resource-metadata discovery, authorization-server metadata
 * discovery, dynamic client registration, the token exchange and the refresh
 * all went out with no `AbortSignal` at all. Token revocation was the single
 * exception — `revocation.ts` has carried its own deadline since #2144, and it
 * is the pattern this module generalizes.
 *
 * An unbounded fetch matters more here than it usually would, because of where
 * this work runs and what the UI does while it runs:
 *
 * - It runs **server-side**, in the Inspector's own Node process, proxied
 *   through the backend. A stall is therefore invisible in browser devtools —
 *   #2188's reporter correctly observed that no request left the browser at
 *   all while a Node-side socket sat established and idle.
 * - Connect-time auth errors deliberately hold the connection status at
 *   `"connecting"` rather than moving it to `"error"`
 *   (`isConnectAuthRecoveryError`, `challenge.ts`), on the theory that a
 *   redirect is about to end the attempt. A stalled fetch inside that window is
 *   a silent, unbounded spinner rather than a surfaced failure.
 *
 * The deadline covers the **whole exchange**, not just the headers: `fetch`
 * resolves as soon as response headers arrive, so a server that sends headers
 * — or half a JSON document — and then stalls would leave the caller's
 * `response.json()` hanging with nothing watching it. Every response on this
 * path is a small finite document, so a *clone* of it is drained under the same
 * race and the original — untouched, with every native slot intact — is what
 * the caller gets.
 *
 * Today the common case is bounded, but only incidentally: a discovery stall
 * that happens to sit inside an SDK `initialize` rides that request's own
 * timeout and surfaces after 60s as `Request timed out`. This module makes the
 * bound deliberate, applies it to the stalls that sit *outside* an SDK request
 * too, and — the point of naming the URL in the error — says *which* endpoint
 * stalled instead of blaming the handshake.
 *
 * ## The signal, the proxy hop, and why the race is still here
 *
 * The signal is the primary mechanism and it now reaches all the way out. On a
 * direct fetch (CLI, TUI, backend) it cancels the request outright. In the
 * browser the OAuth fetch is `createRemoteFetch`, which re-issues the call as a
 * POST to `/api/fetch` — and as of #2319 it forwards the signal onto that hop,
 * where the route composes `c.req.raw.signal` into its own outbound fetch. So
 * an abort here tears down the backend's request to the authorization server
 * rather than leaving it running detached, which is what it used to do.
 *
 * The race is kept anyway, and it is not redundant. It bounds what the signal
 * cannot: a `fetchFn` that ignores `AbortSignal` altogether — an injected or
 * test double, or any future transport that drops it the way the proxy used to
 * — and a backend that is itself wedged, where the outbound request is
 * cancelled but the hop back never completes. A deadline that depends on every
 * layer beneath it honouring a signal is not a deadline. Same reasoning, same
 * shape, as `revokeToken`.

/**
 * Build the `isExempt` predicate for a chain that carries MCP traffic as well as

 *
 * ⚠️ **Fails open, deliberately.** The two errors are not symmetric. Bounding a
 * request that should not be bounded severs a long-running tool call or an SSE
 * stream — a severe, user-visible regression. Failing to bound one leaves the
 * SDK's own per-request timeout as the backstop it has always been. So anything
 * uncertain — no server URL yet, a URL that will not parse, either side — is
 * treated as the MCP endpoint and exempted.
 *
 * The comparison is **as narrow as the transport allows**, which is not the same
 * rule for both of them:
 *
 * - **Streamable HTTP** sends every MCP request to the configured URL, so
 *   `origin + pathname` is exact. Same-origin OAuth work — a protected-resource
 *   document, or an authorization server deployed beside the resource — is a
 *   different path and stays bounded, which is what #2319 asks for (Copilot).
 * - **Legacy SSE** opens the configured URL (`/sse`), is handed a *separate*
 *   message endpoint by the server, and POSTs every JSON-RPC message to that
 *   second pathname. We never see that URL — it arrives inside the stream, in
 *   the SDK's own parser — so a path rule there bounds and body-buffers real
 *   MCP traffic, severing a slow tool call at 30s and reporting it as an
 *   `OAuthRequestTimeoutError`. Origin is the narrowest rule available, and it
 *   is exact rather than approximate: the SDK *enforces* that the message
 *   endpoint shares the stream URL's origin and rejects one that does not.
 *
 * So the residual gap is confined to legacy SSE against a server that also
 * hosts its own OAuth endpoints, where transport-internal OAuth falls back to
 * the SDK's per-request timeout — where it was before #2319. The Inspector's
 * own discovery and token requests to those URLs are bounded regardless, on the
 * OAuth chain.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Fails open** on every uncertainty, and the uncertainties differ by rule:
 * no server URL, an unparseable URL on either side, or *not knowing which
 * transport this is* all resolve to exempt — the last one by falling back to
 * the wider origin rule.

 * chain passes `exemptMcpEndpoint`.
 *
 * `isExempt` receives the request's URL **and headers**, because a URL alone
 * cannot always tell the two kinds of traffic apart — see `exemptMcpEndpoint`.
 *
 * `isExempt` lets one wrapped fetch serve a mixed chain. It is how the
 * *transport* fetch can be bounded at all: that chain carries both the SDK's

 * not be bounded breaks a working tool call; failing to bound one leaves the
 * SDK's own per-request timeout as the backstop it already was.
 *
 * A caller's own signal is preserved — whether it arrived in `init` or embedded
 * in a `Request` — and is both forwarded to the inner fetch (composed with
