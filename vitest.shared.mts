    // at all, it arrived in `clients/cli` as a peer of `express-rate-limit`

    // root copy on its own today — nothing declares it in a client — and this

    // the same resolution reason rather than because `core/` imports it. Each
    // used to be declared by the clients that reached it and was pinned to
    // `<client>/node_modules` accordingly; once the declarations went away
    // those paths stopped existing, so the pin has to follow the package to
    // the root. Left un-repointed they would resolve

    // unrelated dependency happened to drag in, which is the duplicate this

    // so an unpinned bare import from a web test resolves the client copy while
    // `core/` and the SDK packages resolve the root's (Copilot).

    // `@modelcontextprotocol/*` surface. The versions are identical today and
