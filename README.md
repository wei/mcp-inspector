# MCP Inspector

A developer tool for inspecting [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) servers. It ships as a single package, `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`, that provides three ways to inspect a server:

- **Web** — a Vite + React + [Mantine](https://mantine.dev) single-page app with a Node backend.
- **CLI** — a scriptable command-line client for automation, CI, and fast agent feedback loops.
- **TUI** — an interactive terminal UI built with [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

All three run through one global `mcp-inspector` binary:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector          # web UI (default)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --cli    # CLI
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --tui    # TUI
```

> **Upgrading from v1?** Read the [v1 → v2 migration guide](./docs/v1-to-v2-migration.md) — CLI flags, the new `--config` vs. `--catalog` split, the Node engine bump, and what no longer ships.

> **Repo status.** This is the **v2** line of the Inspector. Active development happens on **`v2/main`** (the develop branch — all v2 PRs target it), which is merged into **`main`** at milestone releases; `main` is the default branch and holds the latest released v2, published to the npm `latest` tag. The legacy **v1** line lives on **`v1/main`** — security fixes only, published straight from that branch to the npm `v1-latest` tag (`npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector@v1-latest`). See [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) for branch/board conventions.

## Quick start (development)

Requires Node `>=22.19.0`.

```bash
npm install          # at the repo root; postinstall cascades into every client
npm run build        # web → cli → tui → launcher
```

For day-to-day **web** iteration, run Vite directly — fast HMR, no launcher build needed:

```bash
cd clients/web && npm run dev
```

The launcher-driven scripts run the **built** launcher, so build first:

```bash
npm run web        # prod web launcher against clients/web/dist
npm run web:dev    # web launcher in --dev mode (Vite)
```

v2 is **not** an npm workspace — each client under `clients/*` keeps its own `package.json` and `node_modules`, and shared code lives in `core/`, consumed via a `@inspector/core` build-time alias. **Every runtime dependency `core/` imports is declared once, in the repo-root `package.json`**, and each client declares only what that client alone consumes — its UI stack, its bundler-inlined packages, its dev tooling — which leaves `clients/cli` and `clients/launcher` with no runtime dependencies of their own. What that means for adding a dependency (root vs. client, `dependencies` vs. `devDependencies`, and the bundler `external` lists) is in the [`local-dev` skill](./.claude/skills/local-dev/SKILL.md).

Each client has its own README with client-specific detail:
[web](./clients/web/README.md) · [cli](./clients/cli/README.md) · [tui](./clients/tui/README.md) · [launcher](./clients/launcher/README.md).

## Testing and the quality gate

Each client self-validates from its own folder; the root scripts chain them. There is **no** aggregate root `test` script.

```bash
npm run validate     # fast inner loop: format:check + lint + typecheck + build + unit tests
npm run coverage     # the per-file ≥90% gate (lines/statements/functions/branches)
npm run local:gate   # MANDATORY before pushing — a strict superset of GitHub CI
```

`npm run local:gate` chains every check below, plus the smokes and the Storybook tests. [Testing and the quality gate](./docs/quality-gate.md) owns the stage list and says what each one covers and why two are local-only; [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) holds the testing rules themselves.

## Contributing — `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and the skills

**[`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md) is the contract for changing this codebase, and it applies to humans and AI agents alike.** It is not agent-only boilerplate — it holds the project's real **rules**: the version/label conventions, the TypeScript and Mantine/React standards, the testing and coverage requirements, and the mandatory pre-push gate. Read it before making changes, and keep it up to date when you change structure, tooling, or rules.

The repo's **procedures** — multi-step recipes with commands and live IDs — live in [`.claude/skills/`](./.claude/skills) instead, one directory per procedure, so they are loaded only when the task calls for them. They are ordinary committed Markdown: an agent that doesn't understand skills can read them, and `AGENTS.md` carries an index of what exists. Claude Code users invoke one by name (`/release`, `/issue-triage`, …).

`CLAUDE.md` is the entry point [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) loads automatically; it includes `AGENTS.md`, so agents and humans work from the same source of truth. If you use a different agent that reads `AGENTS.md`, you get the same rules.

A key rule worth surfacing here: **all work is issue-driven.** Before starting, find or create a tracking issue on the v2 project board; open PRs against `v2/main` with `Closes #<issue>`. External contributions are accepted as **issues, not pull requests** — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
