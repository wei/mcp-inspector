/**
 * The one place `test-servers/build` is produced for a script consumer (#2111).
 *
 * Five scripts used to carry their own `ensureTestServer()`, each returning
 * early when the output was already on disk. Presence is not freshness: once
 * `test-servers/build` exists — which it does on any machine that has run the
 * smokes once — an edit to `test-servers/src` was never picked up again, and
 * the smoke kept driving the previously-built fixture.
 *
 * That failure is silent *and* misattributed. It does not read as "your fixture
 * is stale", it reads as a product bug: a `v2/main` merge that touched
 * `preset-registry.ts` made `smoke:web:app` report the dedicated app-origin
 * path as broken, and two unrelated hypotheses were measured out before the
 * real cause surfaced. The **tests** have always built the same fixture
 * unconditionally (`pretest`, `test:coverage`, `test:integration` all run
 * `test-servers:build`), so the weaker policy sat on exactly the checks that
 * spawn real servers and are hardest to debug when wrong.
 *
 * So: build every time, from here. `tsc -p test-servers --noCheck` costs ~1s
 * cold and less when `incremental` finds its `.tsbuildinfo` up to date, against
 * smokes that take tens of seconds and a `pack:verify` that does a real
 * `npm install` from the registry.
 *
 * ⚠️ Unconditional emit is not a clean: `--noCheck` emit leaves the stale `.js`
 * of a *deleted* `src` file behind, and no path here removes it. That is
 * unchanged from before (the old early-return only skipped the build; it never
 * cleaned either), and it is a loud failure rather than a silent one — an
 * import of a removed module fails at the consumer. Fixing it properly means
 * `tsc -b` with `composite`, which forces `declaration` on and drops
 * `--noCheck`; not worth it for this. `rm -rf test-servers/build` if you have
 * deleted a source file.
 *
 * The root-installed tsc is run via this Node — `npx` is a `.cmd` shim on
 * Windows that a shell-free spawnSync can't start (ENOENT — #1939). That is
 * also one of the drifts consolidating fixed: `pack-and-verify.mjs` still
 * shelled out to `npx tsc`, so it alone was unrunnable on Windows.
