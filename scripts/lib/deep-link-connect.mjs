/**
 * The **connect** half of a headless web smoke: build the deep link, navigate
 * to it, and wait until the Inspector reports a live connection (#2148).
 *
 * Every browser-driven smoke that touches a server starts the same way — the
 * `?serverUrl=…&transport=http&autoConnect=<token>` link, the `data-deeplink`
 * token gate, and the `data-status="connected"` wait. `smoke:web:app` had it
 * inside `driveAppFlow`, and `smoke:web:elicit` carried a second, hand-rolled
 * copy; a third copy for the tab smoke is what this exists to prevent.
 *
 * Sharing it matters more than the line count. The deep link's shape is owned
 * by clients/web/README.md#deep-link-auto-connect and enforced by
 * `parseDeepLink`, which **ignores** a link it cannot validate rather than
 * reporting one — so a drifted copy does not fail as a mismatch, it fails as an
 * opaque 45s connect timeout in whichever smoke was not updated. One copy is
 * one thing to keep right.
 *
 * The two gates are separate on purpose and both are worth asserting:
 *
 *   - `data-deeplink` distinguishes "the link was rejected by the CSRF token
 *     gate" from "no deep link was present at all". Without it a bad token
 *     reads as a connect that simply never happened.
 *   - `data-status` is the connection itself.
 *
 * Takes only the slice of Playwright's `page` it uses (`goto`, `locator` →
 * `waitFor`/`getAttribute`), which is what lets its failure branches be
 * unit-tested against a stand-in — a smoke only ever drives its happy path.
 */
