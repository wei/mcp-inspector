/**
 * The local-gate-out-of-CI guard (#2146), in two halves.
 *
 * The table-driven half pins one case per rule the parser encodes — including
 * the negative cases, which are the ones that matter most here: a guard that
 * also rejected `npm run smoke` or `smoke:web:chromium` would be "fixed" by
 * deleting it, taking the real protection with it.
 *
 * The second half runs the parser over the repository's ACTUAL workflow files.
 * That is the assertion the issue asks for: it fails the moment a workflow
 * invokes the pre-push gate, a non-Chromium engine pass, or `smoke:web:engine`,
 * or points `SMOKE_BROWSER` at something else.
