/**
 * Wrap a command so it runs attached to a pseudoterminal (#2147).
 *
 * `smoke:tui` spawns the Ink TUI with `stdio: ["ignore", …]`, which makes the
 * child's stdin `/dev/null`. Ink mounts `useInput`, `useInput` needs raw mode,
 * and raw mode is a property of the *file descriptor* — so the child threw
 * "Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin" and exited 1 about
 * 40ms after painting its first frame, on every machine, TTY or not. A parent
 * cannot assert raw mode on a child's behalf; the fd has to be a terminal.
 *
 * `script(1)` allocates one, with no dependency to install. Measured here on
 * darwin: without it the TUI paints at ~400ms and is dead at ~440ms; with it
 * the same TUI is still running at 6s and never logs the raw-mode error.
 *
 * The invocation differs by flavor, which is why this is a module rather than
 * a string literal at the call site:
 *
 *   BSD (macOS)   script -q /dev/null <cmd> <args...>       argv, no shell
 *   util-linux    script -qec "<cmd args...>" /dev/null     ONE shell string
 *   busybox       script -qc  "<cmd args...>" /dev/null     as above, no -e
 *
 * The `-c` flavors take a single command *string* that the child shell parses,
 * so every word has to be quoted on the way in — an unquoted temp path with a
 * space would otherwise split into two arguments.
 *
 * `-e` (util-linux) makes `script` exit with the child's status rather than its
 * own. busybox has no such flag, so under it a crashed child reports 0. That is
 * survivable and deliberately not worked around: the smoke's assertion is the
 * child's `exit` *event*, not its code — the code only sharpens the diagnostic.
