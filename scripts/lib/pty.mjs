/**
 * Wrap a command so it runs attached to a pseudoterminal (#2147).
 *
 * `smoke:tui` spawns the Ink TUI with `stdio: ["ignore", …]`, which makes the
 * child's stdin `/dev/null`. Ink mounts `useInput`, `useInput` needs raw mode,
 * and raw mode is a property of the *file descriptor* — so the child threw
 * "Raw mode is not supported on the current process.stdin" and exited 1 about
 * 40ms after painting its first frame, on every machine, TTY or not. A parent
 * cannot assert raw mode on a child's behalf; the fd has to be a terminal.
 *
 * `script(1)` allocates one, with no dependency to install. Measured here on
 * darwin: without it the TUI paints at ~400ms and is dead at ~440ms; with it
 * the same TUI is still running at 6s and never logs the raw-mode error.
 *
 * The invocation differs by flavor, which is why this is a module rather than
 * a string literal at the call site:
 *
 *   BSD (macOS)   script -q /dev/null <cmd> <args...>       argv, no shell
 *   util-linux    script -qec "<cmd args...>" /dev/null     ONE shell string
 *   busybox       script -qc  "<cmd args...>" /dev/null     as above, no -e
 *
 * The `-c` flavors take a single command *string* that the child shell parses,
 * so every word has to be quoted on the way in — an unquoted temp path with a
 * space would otherwise split into two arguments.
 *
 * `-e` (util-linux) makes `script` exit with the child's status rather than its
 * own. busybox has no such flag, so under it a crashed child reports 0. That is
 * survivable and deliberately not worked around: the smoke's assertion is the
 * child's `exit` *event*, not its code — the code only sharpens the diagnostic.

 *
 * The number matters less than what its expiry means. `spawnSync` reports a

 * read both as "no `script(1)`" — so a starved probe turned `smoke:tui` into a
 * documented **skip**, exit 0, with a message blaming the machine's PATH. A

 * from "a `script` that printed nothing", and collapsing both to `""` is
 * actively harmful: on linux the empty output falls through to the
 * `util-linux` guess, and `smoke:tui` then hard-fails spawning a binary that
 * does not exist, instead of taking the documented skip. Hence the `available`
 * flag rather than a bare string. The `catch` stays for a runner that really
 * does throw (an injected one, or a future spawn shape).
 *
 * A non-zero exit is NOT unavailability: BSD `script` has no `--version` and
 * answers `illegal option -- -` plus its usage on stderr — which is exactly the
 * evidence `scriptFlavorFor` reads. Only `error` means "could not run it".
 *
 * A **timeout** is not unavailability either, and it is the one `error` that
 * must not be folded into "not available": `script(1)` was found and started,
 * and the machine did not let it finish. Reporting that as "no `script(1)` on
