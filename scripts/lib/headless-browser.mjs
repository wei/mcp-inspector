/**
 * The headless browser the web smokes drive: which engine, how it is launched,
 * and the two error channels a page reports on (#2086).
 *
 * All three smokes (`smoke:web:browser`, `smoke:web:app`, `smoke:web:elicit`)
 * and `pack:verify` go through here, so the engine is a parameter in exactly
 * one place and the diagnostics split is stated once rather than hand-rolled
 * four times.
 *
 * Every browser-driven check in this repo used to be Chromium-only. That is
 * fine for most of the web client, whose behavior is React and Mantine — and it
 * is NOT fine for the MCP Apps sandbox, which is built out of exactly the
 * primitives that diverge between engines: a CSP `<meta>` injected into a
 * `srcdoc` document, a nested sandboxed iframe, a `Permissions-Policy` `allow`
 * attribute, and `postMessage` origin discipline across those two frames. A
 * regression in any of those is invisible unless it also reproduces in Chromium.
 *
 * The unit tests cannot cover it either: `sandbox-csp.test.ts` asserts which
 * policy STRING is built, which would pass identically on an engine that
 * ignores `<meta>` CSP entirely. And no Storybook story reaches the sandbox at
 * all — all three App stories point the iframe at a `data:` placeholder and hand
 * the renderer a mock bridge. So the smokes are the only place the sandbox is
 * genuinely exercised, and this module is what lets them be pointed at another
 * engine.
 *
 * ⚠️ Playwright's WebKit is a WebKit build, not Safari. It is close enough to
 * catch engine-level CSP and iframe divergence, and not close enough to certify
 * Safari specifically — a green run here is not a Safari guarantee.
 *
 * **And that cuts both ways: a RED run here is not a Safari indictment.** The
 * WebKit App-smoke failure was once written up as a Safari bug on the strength
 * of a failure in this build alone; a manual check in Safari did not reproduce
 * it, an isolated repro of the claimed mechanism did not reproduce it here
 * either, and the whole line of investigation was dropped. Reproduce in the real
 * browser before describing a finding as one users hit.
 *
 * Playwright is resolved with a `createRequire` based at
 * clients/web/package.json rather than a bare `import("playwright")`: a bare ESM
 * specifier resolves relative to `scripts/`, not the cwd, so a `cd clients/web`
 * in the npm script would NOT make it resolvable. See smoke-web-browser.mjs's
 * header for the full gotcha.

 *   - **not resolvable** means the Playwright *npm package* is missing, fixed by
 *     `npm install` at the repo root. `playwright install` (which fetches
 *     browser binaries) would not help and is the wrong thing to suggest.
 *   - **launch rejected** means the package is there but that engine's *binary*
 *     is not, fixed by `playwright install --with-deps <that engine>`. Naming
 *     "chromium" while WebKit was the missing one sends the reader off to
 *     install a browser they already have — the reason the engine is
 *     interpolated rather than hard-coded (#2086's acceptance criterion).
 *
 * `loadPlaywright` is injectable purely so those branches can be unit-tested.
 * They are unreachable from the smokes by construction: `install-smoke-browser`
 * runs first and fetches the binary, so a passing smoke proves nothing about the
 * message a failing one would print — and that message IS the deliverable here,
 * since its whole job is to be read by someone whose setup is broken.
