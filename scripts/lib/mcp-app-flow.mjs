/**
 * The MCP Apps drive-the-App-flow half of `smoke:web:app`, extracted so
 * `pack:verify` can run the same flow against the **installed tarball** (#2003).
 *
 * Two checks bracketed the bug that motivated all of this (#1859, the missing
 * `clients/web/static/sandbox_proxy.html`) without either one catching it:
 *
 *   | check           | runs against       | drives the App path? |
 *   | --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- |
 *   | `smoke:web:app` | the repo build tree | yes                 |
 *   | `pack:verify`   | the installed tarball | no — only `GET /` |
 *
 * So a packaging regression that leaves the file present-but-unreachable — a
 * rename with a stale reader, a wrong relative position, a future `.npmignore`
 * or `"files"` edit — passes both: the smoke never installs, and `pack:verify`
 * only asserted the path *exists*. Sharing the flow is what closes it, and it
 * has to be *shared* rather than copied: the deep-link shape is the part that
 * silently rots, and two copies would drift without either failing.
 *
 * Note the split of responsibilities that survives here. The **client** under
 * test comes from wherever the caller booted it (repo tree or install); the
 * **test server** is always a repo fixture — it is not in the tarball and
 * should not be.
 *
 * Launching the browser is NOT this module's job — `lib/headless-browser.mjs`
 * owns that, so the engine is a parameter rather than a hard-coded Chromium
 * (#2086) and so `smoke:web:browser`, which does not drive an App at all, can
 * share it without importing this file.

/**
 * Drive **connect → open app → widget ready** on an already-open page.
 *
 * The load-bearing assertion is the `data-app-status="ready"` contract
 * documented in clients/web/README.md ("MCP Apps screen automation contract"):
 * the renderer reports `ready` only once the widget has loaded inside the
 * sandbox iframe *and* fired `notifications/initialized` back through the
 * bridge. So one attribute covers the whole path — the sandbox controller
 * serving the proxy page, the proxy loading the UI resource, and the bridge
 * completing its handshake.
 *
 * Throws with the last observed `data-app-status` / `data-app-error` rather than
 * a bare timeout, so a failure names its stage.
 *
 * Three knobs exist for `smoke:web:app`'s second phase (#2056), which
 * re-navigates the *same* page to a second server declaring `_meta.ui.domain`:
 *
 *   - `expectDeepLink` — the token gate is only worth asserting on the first
 *     navigate. A re-navigate that were rejected fails at the connect wait
 *     anyway, and phase 2's real subject is the origin, not the gate.
 *   - `what` — the noun in the ready-failure message, so a phase-2 timeout does
 *     not read as a phase-1 one.
 *   - `extraDiagnostics` — appended to that message. Phase 2 lists the page's
 *     frames, which is what distinguishes "the app never rendered" from "it
 *     rendered at the wrong origin".
 *
 * Takes only the small slice of Playwright's `page` it uses (`goto`, `locator`
 * → `waitFor`/`getAttribute`/`count`), which is what lets its failure paths be
 * unit-tested against a stand-in — a smoke only ever exercises its happy path.
