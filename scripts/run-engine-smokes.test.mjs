/**
 * The engine-smoke runner's list (#2086).
 *
 * `ENGINE_SMOKES` is the single home for "which smokes are engine-sensitive",
 * and the thing that can silently rot about it is a smoke going missing — the
 * suite still passes, just covering less. Nothing at runtime notices, because a
 * shorter list is a *successful* run.
 *
 * Importing the module must not spawn anything; `main()` is behind an entrypoint
 * guard, and this test would catch that regressing by running three browser
 * smokes the moment the suite imported it.
