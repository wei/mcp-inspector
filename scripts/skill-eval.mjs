// Trigger eval for the model-invoked skills in `.claude/skills` (#2163).
//
// `verify:skills` asserts a skill is well-formed and that its cases exist. This
// runs them: each prompt is executed headless in a FRESH session and we assert
// on whether the Skill tool fired with the expected skill.
//
// Seeing a skill fire once tells us Claude found it, not that it finds it
// reliably — the measurement is a hit rate over repeated fresh sessions. It
// needs negative cases too: a skill that fires on everything is a context
// regression, and it is the failure nobody notices by hand. `verify:skills`
// requires both.
//
// NOT part of `validate`, `local:gate`, or CI, and that is a decision rather
// than an omission. A trigger eval cannot be a gate: it spends metered model
// calls on every push, the measurement IS a hit rate over samples so it is
// non-deterministic by construction, and it goes red on a rate limit or an
// expired token — failures unrelated to the diff, whose first consequence is
// that people stop trusting the gate. Run it when adding a skill or editing a
// model-invoked skill's description.
//
// The cost of that split, stated plainly: neither `verify:skills` nor the
// authoritative `claude plugin validate` CI step can detect a well-formed skill
// whose description simply never matches anything. Both check structure.
// Closing that would need a deterministic trigger oracle, which does not exist.
//
// Usage:
//   npm run skills:eval                        # every model-invoked skill's cases
//   npm run skills:eval -- testing             # one skill's cases
//   npm run skills:eval -- testing test-servers  # several skills' cases
//   RUNS=5 THRESHOLD=0.8 npm run skills:eval
//
// Two kinds of case, measured and reported separately (#2204). A `expect` case
// is a FIRST-MOVE measurement: one turn, does the model reach for the skill
// before anything else. A `chain` case is a HAND-OFF measurement: many turns,
// does loading skill A actually lead the model to load skill B. The two numbers
// are not comparable — a hand-off is a second-hop load that only happens once
// the run has established it needs one — so they never share a column.

// reliability for a SECOND-HOP load, not a claim that 0.8 is unreachable. One
// well-shaped pointer has cleared 0.8 outright: the committed `testing` ->
// `test-servers` cases measured 33% (RUNS=3) when `testing` merely classified
// which work belonged to `test-servers`, and 100%/100% (RUNS=5) once #2247
// reshaped that into an imperative step. That is ONE pointer over ONE edit that
// moved wording and placement together, so read it as an existence proof that
// the ceiling is above 0.8 — not as a general property of "well-shaped"
// pointers, and not as grounds for raising this floor (Copilot, #2264). (An intermediate build of that change

// threshold is compared strictly, so 80% would fail one — but it is worth
// knowing as the residual noise still present at RUNS=5.) What 0.5 buys
// is a column that still separates an adequate pointer from a broken one — a
// hand-off is a noisier measurement than a first move, so a bar set where a
// STRONG pointer sits would mark both red.
// A reshaped pointer therefore raises the ceiling those cases reach, not the
// floor a *new* hand-off case should be judged against.
//
