/**
 * Headless-browser boot smoke for the prod web client (#1615).
 *
 * `smoke:web` (scripts/smoke-web.mjs) only asserts that `GET /` serves the SPA
 * HTML with the injected auth token — it never executes the React app, so a
 * regression that only manifests when the bundle *runs* slips through. The
 * canonical example (#1612): the browser bundle transitively value-imported a
 * Node-only module (`store-io` → `atomically` → `stubborn-fs` → `node:process`),
 * pulling a Node built-in into the browser graph and crashing the app to a blank
 * page at runtime. Unit/integration tests run in node / happy-dom, never a real
 * browser bundle, so none of them caught it.
 *
 * The assertion: the prod bundle **boots and paints its first meaningful frame
 * (the "Add Servers" control) with no uncaught page error.** That is how a
 * Node-only module reaching the browser bundle actually manifests under Vite:
 * the excluded module is replaced by an empty stub, and the first call into it
 * (e.g. `fs.readFileSync(...)` during a transitive module's init) throws a
 * `TypeError` that aborts app mount — an uncaught `pageerror` here.
 *
 * What this does NOT rely on: the literal `Module "…" has been externalized`
 * string. Under Vite 8 that is a **build-time** warning (surfaced by
 * `vite build`, i.e. `npm run build`), not a runtime message — the shipped stub
 * is a silent `module.exports = {}`. So the browser never sees that string; the
 * load-bearing signal is the uncaught `TypeError`. (Corollary: an externalized
 * import that is never *called* ships a harmless empty object and is invisible
 * to this smoke by design — an unused Node import doesn't crash the app.)
 *
 * Two channels carry the failure. A *synchronous* uncaught exception (the
 * CASE-1 shape above — a stub call during module init) fires `pageerror`. Its
 * *async* twin — the same `TypeError` reached through an `await`/`.then()`, or a
 * failed dynamic import (this app lazy-loads chunks) — is NOT a `pageerror`; it
 * arrives on the **console** channel as `Uncaught (in promise) …` /
 * `Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`. Both are hard failures, and
 * both channels are read on every engine rather than branching per browser.
 *
 * Every *other* `console.error` is NOT a hard failure: the console is also where
 * benign things a boot smoke shouldn't fail on land — a failed
 * subresource load (e.g. the Google-Fonts `<link>` in index.html on a
 * network-restricted box) or a React key/prop warning. Those are printed as
 * diagnostics. The `Uncaught` / dynamic-import prefixes are unambiguous — a
 * font/CDN miss reads `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_…` and a React warning
 * never starts with `Uncaught` — so hard-failing on them can't reintroduce that
 * flake.
 *
 * Launching the browser (and resolving Playwright from clients/web, which has
 * its own gotcha — see `lib/headless-browser.mjs`) is delegated to that module,
 * which is also where `SMOKE_BROWSER` picks the engine: `chromium` (the
 * default), `firefox`, or `webkit` (#2086). GitHub CI runs this in **Chromium**
 * only; `npm run ci`, the local pre-push gate, also runs it in **Firefox** via
 * `smoke:web:firefox`; **WebKit is on demand only**. This smoke passes in all
 * three — it is the two App smokes that fail under WebKit (see their headers).
 *
 * The engine question here is narrower than in the App smokes — this asserts a clean
 * first paint, i.e. that the shipped bundle's syntax and API level are
 * *reachable* on the engine at all, rather than anything about the sandbox — but
 * it is real, and it is nearly free to include.
 *
 * Expects `clients/web/dist` and `clients/launcher/build` to be built first —
 * the validate / CI ordering guarantees this.
