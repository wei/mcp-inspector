// Durable guard for `.claude/skills/**/SKILL.md` (#2163).
//
// `AGENTS.md` is loaded in full on every turn, so its rules are unconditionally
// present. A skill is conditional — its body loads only when it is invoked — so
// if a skill stops being reachable we lose behavior SILENTLY, and nothing in the
// normal workflow surfaces that. This is the check that does.
//
// What it asserts, cheapest first:
//   1. Every SKILL.md's frontmatter parses the way Claude Code parses it. This
//      is the whole-class failure: malformed YAML (or a fence that is not the
//      first line) loads the body with EMPTY metadata, so `/name` still works —
//      a manual spot check passes — while the description the model matches
//      against is gone and the skill never auto-fires again.
//   2. Every skill declares its invocation mode explicitly, so the set that has
//      to fire on its own is knowable by reading the files rather than inferred.
//   3. Every model-invoked skill has committed eval cases, including negatives.
//      Cases are run by `npm run skills:eval`, which needs the Claude CLI and is
//      therefore NOT in the gate; the cases existing is what this checks.
//   4. The skill LISTING stays inside its recorded character budget. Claude Code
//      truncates the listing when it overflows, dropping the least-invoked
//      entries first — which are exactly the model-invoked skills.
//
// It additionally runs `claude plugin validate` when that CLI is on PATH. That
// is the authoritative parse, but it cannot be a requirement: the CLI is absent
// in CI and on a contributor's machine, and a guard that skips itself wherever
// it actually runs is worse than one that reimplements the check.

/**
 * Whether a shell script invokes exactly `command`.
 *
 * A substring test is not enough, and my own justification for one was wrong:
 * it accepts a LONGER script name (`npm run verify:skills:cli:disabled`) and a
 * script merely named by another command (`echo npm run verify:skills:cli`),
 * either of which would let the real validator be removed while this guard
 * stayed green (Copilot).
 *
 * So the script is split on the separators that start a new command, and a
 * segment must equal the invocation exactly. That is precise for the commands
 * this guard checks, which take no arguments; a command that did would need
 * prefix matching with an argument boundary instead.
 *
 * Splitting is on `\n`, `;` and `&&` only — deliberately NOT on `|` or a bare
 * `&`. `||` is the failure-masking form, and both of its shapes must be
 * rejected: `npm run X || true` swallows a rejection so CI stays green, and
 * `true || npm run X` never runs the validator at all (Copilot). Leaving `||`
 * inside the segment means the segment does not equal the invocation, so both
 * are refused without special-casing either.

 * @param {string} command e.g. `npm run verify:skills:cli`.

 * unconditional, so must the STEP, and neither may carry `continue-on-error` —
 * a step whose failure cannot fail the job asserts nothing, so a rejected skill
 * would leave the workflow green (Copilot).
 *
 * Deliberately conservative: a job or step carrying **any** `if:` is skipped.
 * This guard cannot evaluate an Actions expression, and the property being
 * asserted is "CI validates the skills on a PR" — which a conditional step does
 * not establish. Over-strictness costs a false failure that is obvious to fix;

/**
 * Assert the two skill gates are still WIRED, not merely present.
 *
 * A gate that stops being invoked fails silently and every fixture test stays
 * green — which is the same failure the sibling guards' vouch cycle exists to
 * prevent, so this joins it (Copilot). Two distinct links:
 *
 *   - `verify:skills` (this file) must be reachable from the root `validate`.
 *     It cannot detect its own absence, so `verify:format-coverage` vouches for
 *     it and this vouches back — the established cycle.
 *   - `verify:skills:cli` must be in `local:gate` AND in the workflow. That is
 *     the step that actually runs the authoritative validator, and it is
 *     reachable from neither `validate` nor any test, so nothing else would
 *     notice it going missing.
 *
 * The workflow half must find a step that **actually runs on a PR**, which takes
 * two narrowings beyond a text search:
 *
 *   - Executable position. A raw substring match is satisfied by a comment, a
 *     step `name:`, or a workflow input default that merely mentions the
 *     command — so deleting the real step while leaving this docblock's wording
 *     nearby would keep the guard green.
 *   - Unconditional execution. A `run:` inside a release-only job, or behind
 *     `if: false`, is still syntactically a `run:` — so a step moved there
 *     would report as wired while PR CI validated nothing (Copilot). Any `if:`
 *     on the job or the step disqualifies it: this guard cannot evaluate an
 *     expression, and "runs sometimes" is not the property being asserted.
