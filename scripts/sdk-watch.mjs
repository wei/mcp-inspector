// Nightly MCP SDK watch (#1063).
//
// Staying abreast of SDK releases had been a manual habit rather than a
// mechanism, which is what #1063 was filed to fix. This script is the
// mechanism: once a night it compares the `@modelcontextprotocol/*` packages
// this repo installs against what the registry publishes, and files ONE
// tracking issue per upstream that is behind.
//
//   npm registry -> this sweep -> issue (labeled, milestoned) -> maintainer PR -> v2/main
//
// It is the third instance of a shape this repo already runs twice
// (`dependency-refresh.mjs`, `dependabot-alerts.mjs`) and it deliberately files
// an ISSUE rather than opening a PR, for the reason #2229 exists: a
// bot-authored PR carries no `Closes #N` and no board card, so the work is
// invisible to the project board.
//
// Four things shape the design, each verified against this repo before it was
// written:
//
//  1. **Two upstreams, not one.** `client`/`core`/`server`/`server-legacy` all
//     ship from `modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk` and release in lockstep;
//     `ext-apps` ships from its own repo on its own cadence. Treating them as
//     one group would file an issue naming a version that only some of the
//     packages have, so `SDK_GROUPS` keeps them separate and each gets its own
//     issue and its own marker.
//  2. **Compare the INSTALLED version, not the declared range.** #1063 phrases
//     the check as "is the current version > than the one we have in our
//     package.json", which is exact today only because the four SDK packages
//     are pinned exactly. `ext-apps` is a caret range, so its lockfile can
//     already resolve higher than the manifest's floor, and comparing against
//     the declared string would file an issue for a bump `npm install` has
//     already taken. The declared range is still reported — it is what says
//     whether the fix is a manifest edit or a lockfile refresh — but the
//     comparison is against the lockfile.
//  3. **A new SDK package must not be watched silently by nobody.** The group
//     table is a hardcoded list, so a fifth `@modelcontextprotocol/*` package
//     added to the root manifest would never be checked and nothing would say
//     so. `assertEveryPackageWatched` turns that into a loud failure instead —
//     the sweep goes red rather than reporting a clean night over a package it
//     never looked at.
//  4. **No board write.** Both siblings want an org-project PAT for that, and
//     `PROJECT_TOKEN` is set nowhere in this org — the only org secret
//     available to this repo is `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. So rather than carry ~90
//     lines of placement code that cannot run (and a second copy of board
//     #28's node ids, which AGENTS.md explicitly calls worse than one), this
//     follows `dependency-refresh.mjs`: the issue is filed labeled and
//     milestoned, and the next `/issue-triage` sweep boards it. That is the
//     documented normal outcome, not a failure.
//
// ⚠️ A scheduled workflow only ever runs from the DEFAULT branch (`main`),
// while we ship from `v2/main`. So the workflow checks `v2/main` out explicitly
// and this script reads the manifests from the working tree — the same shape
// both sibling sweeps use, and the reason `TARGET_BRANCH` is named in the issue
// body rather than left for the reader to assume.
//
// Idempotency key is the marker comment at the top of each issue body, which
// names the group and the target version. A second run the same night is a
// complete no-op. A run after a FURTHER release files a new issue for the new
// target and leaves a supersession comment on the old one — it never closes it,
// because closing is a maintainer act and the board card may already have moved.
//
// The pure halves are tested directly and `main()` through an injected spawn
// function, the same way both siblings do it; `workflow_dispatch` is a
// production trigger, not a test.

 * a legal character in a GitHub username, so no human account can normalize
 * onto `github-actions` — and the labels half of `isSweepAuthored` is an
 * independent check regardless.

 * element. Both callers then read a line as if it were a comment, and both
 * checks are `startsWith` — so a maintainer who quoted `<!-- sdk-watch:analysis
 * -->` at the start of any line of any comment would have permanently convinced
 * the sweep that issue was analyzed, and the retry would never fire again
 * (Copilot). The same held for the supersession marker.
 *
 * `--slurp` returns one array per page, hence the `flat()`. It cannot be
 * combined with `--jq` — `gh` rejects the pair outright — which is exactly why
 * the parsing moved here.
 *
 * ⚠️ It keeps the AUTHOR, not just the body. Reducing a comment to its text
 * discards the only thing that makes its marker trustworthy — this repo is
 * public, so any commenter could otherwise forge one (Copilot). See
 * `AUTOMATION_LOGIN`.
