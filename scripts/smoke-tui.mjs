/**
 * Boot smoke test for the prod TUI launcher path (#1347).
 *
 * `npm run smoke:launcher` only checks `--tui --help`; it never actually starts
 * the Ink app, so the launcher → TUI → core path and `--catalog` loading went
 * unverified by the launcher smokes. This script launches the built launcher in
 * `--tui` mode against a temp `--catalog`, waits for the app to render its first
 * frame (the "MCP Servers" panel), waits again to confirm it is *still running*,
 * then sends SIGTERM and exits.
 *
 * It asserts the TUI boots, renders, and keeps running — not full interaction
 * (driving an Ink UI deterministically is flaky, so this is intentionally a
 * shallow check). Exits non-zero on a crash before or after first paint, or on
 * a render timeout.
 *
 * ## Why it runs under a pseudoterminal (#2147)
 *
 * It used to spawn the TUI with its stdin on `/dev/null` and settle OK the
 * moment the marker appeared. Ink mounts `useInput`, `useInput` needs raw mode,
 * and raw mode is a property of the file descriptor — so the TUI painted one
 * frame and died ~40ms later with "Raw mode is not supported on the current
 * process.stdin". The smoke won that race and reported OK, on every machine,
 * TTY or not: what it actually asserted was *first paint*, not survival.
 *
 * Two changes, and the second is the fix: `scripts/lib/pty.mjs` gives the child
 * a real terminal via `script(1)`, and `scripts/lib/render-smoke.mjs` requires
 * it to outlive its first frame. Without the survival assertion a future
 * harness change reintroduces exactly this false green and nothing notices —
 * which is why that assertion lives in a tested module rather than here.
 *
 * Expects `clients/launcher/build` and `clients/tui/build` to be built first
 * (the validate / CI ordering guarantees this). The bundled stdio test server
 * (`test-servers/build`) is rebuilt on every run — see
 * `scripts/lib/ensure-test-servers.mjs` for why presence isn't freshness.
