/**
 * Run a command under a machine-wide lease, so that concurrent `npm run
 * local:gate` runs in different worktrees queue instead of contending (#2339).
 *
 * **Two things go wrong when gates overlap, and both were measured** on
 * `v2/main` at `aa56551b` (M3, 8 logical cores). A quiet gate took 257s and
 * passed. Two started together in separate worktrees: one **failed** at 279s
 * — `smoke:web:chromium` found its fixed port (6298) held by the other gate's
 * copy of the same smoke — and the survivor took 338s, 1.3x, with the machine
 * half-free for its last minute. So the first problem is deterministic, not a
 * load effect: the web smokes bind fixed ports (6296–6299, plus the sandbox
 * and app-origin ports), so two gates reaching the same smoke together produce
 * a red run whose diff cannot have caused it — exactly the failure #2338
 * exists to stop. The second is load: with three or four sessions (#2323
 * measured sustained load averages of 50–70) every test budget is the wrong
 * number. Run back to back, the same two gates finish green in ~2x257s, and
 * each is measured against the quiet baseline every other #2338 aspect is
 * tuned to. So a second gate waits.
 *
 * **Why a lease and not a load threshold.** Two sessions each polling "is the
 * machine quiet yet?" deadlock on each other — neither ever clears, since each
 * is the reason the other is waiting (#2323). A lease *grants*: exactly one
 * waiter wins the `mkdir`, runs, and releases; the rest keep asking. There is
 * nothing to wait *for* except a release, and a release always comes — see the
 * crash case below.
 *
 * **Why `proper-lockfile`.** `core/auth/node/file-lock.ts` (#2082) records why
 * a hand-rolled election loses to it: `mkdir` is atomic, a live holder
 * refreshes the lock's mtime at `stale / 2` for as long as it lives, and a
 * holder that dies without releasing — a killed terminal, an OOM'd session —
 * stops refreshing, goes stale, and is taken over by the next waiter. That is
 * the whole "how does a crashed holder release" answer, and it is the
 * library's, not ours. The file-lock module's caveats about stale takeover
 * being non-single-winner apply here too and matter less: the worst case is
 * two gates running at once, which is exactly today's behaviour.
 *
 * **Why the lease is machine-wide.** The lock lives under `os.tmpdir()`
 * (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` where a desktop session sets it), never inside a
 * worktree — a lock in the repo would be one per worktree, which is one per
 * session, which coordinates nothing.
 *
 * **Why default-on.** The sessions that need it are the ones that did not
 * think to opt in. `INSPECTOR_SKIP_GATE_LEASE=1` bypasses it, and the first
 * "waiting" line names the holder, its worktree, and that variable, so a wait
 * is never a mystery. It is also never a gate: a lock that cannot be *created*
 * (an unwritable tmpdir) runs the command unleased with a warning, because a
 * coordination aid must not acquire a new way to fail the gate it wraps.
 *
 * **Why the whole gate and not its parallel stages.** The serial stages are
 * not free — `lint` is type-aware and `build` is a full Vite bundle — and a
 * per-stage lease would let two gates interleave into the same 2.5x. One
 * lease around the whole run is the smallest thing that keeps the measured
 * baseline meaningful.
 *
 * Usage: `node scripts/gate-lease.mjs <command> [args...]`. The command runs
 * with inherited stdio in its own process group, so a signal to this process
 * stops the whole tree — `npm run` nests four deep and `sh` forwards nothing —
 * and the lease is released before this process exits with `128 + signal`.
