/**
 * Headless-browser MCP Apps smoke for the prod web client (#1859).
 *
 * `smoke:web:browser` proves the bundle boots and paints its first frame. It
 * stops there — it never connects to a server, so everything downstream of the
 * connect (the Apps tab, the sandbox controller, the UI-protocol bridge) is
 * unexercised by any smoke. This closes that gap: it drives the full
 * **connect → open app → widget ready** chain against a real MCP App server.
 *
 * A second phase (#2056) drives the same app declaring `_meta.ui.domain`, and
 * asserts the thing that field exists for: the app document is served from the
 * backend's dedicated app-origin listener and runs at a REAL origin, not the
 * opaque one whose requests carry `Origin: null`. Both phases end at
 * `data-app-status="ready"`, so only reading the inner frame's own
 * `location.origin` can tell them apart.
 *
 * The flow both phases share lives in `lib/mcp-app-flow.mjs`, shared with
 * `pack:verify` (#2003) — see that header for why it is shared rather than
 * copied, and for the `data-app-status="ready"` contract the assertion rests on.
 *
 * ── What this does and does NOT catch ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This runs against the **repo build tree**, like every other `smoke:*`. That
 * matters for the bug that motivated it: #1859 was a *packaging* failure —
 * `clients/web/static/sandbox_proxy.html` was missing from the published
 * tarball's "files" allowlist. In the repo that file is always present, so this
 * smoke would have stayed green through that entire bug.
 *
 * The packaging dimension is owned by `npm run pack:verify`, which asserts the
 * file in the tarball packlist and on disk after a real install — and, since
 * #2003, drives phase 1's flow against the **installed** bin. Keep both:
 * pack:verify covers the published artifact, this covers the repo tree on every
 * `npm run ci`, where pack:verify (network-bound, local/release-only) does not
 * run — and this is the only one of the two that drives phase 2. Neither
 * subsumes the other.
 *
 * As a cheap extra, this does assert the proxy page exists at the location the
 * runtime resolves it from (`clients/web/build/../static/…`, see
 * server/sandbox-controller.ts) — which catches the file being *moved or
 * renamed* without its reader being updated, a repo-tree failure pack:verify
 * would only find later.
 *
 * ── Which engine ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `SMOKE_BROWSER` picks the engine (`chromium` — the default — `firefox`, or
 * `webkit`). **CI runs Chromium only.** The other engines are an on-demand tool,
 * not a gate: `SMOKE_BROWSER=firefox npm run smoke:web:engine` before touching
 * the sandbox is cheap and worth doing, but nothing runs it for you (#2086).
 *
 * Firefox passes. WebKit fails this smoke for reasons nobody has identified and
 * nobody is investigating: it does not reproduce in real Safari, and an isolated
 * SSE repro did not reproduce it under Playwright's WebKit either, so it reads
 * as a property of that build rather than a browser bug. Do not read a WebKit
 * failure here as a defect until someone has actually looked.
 *
 * This smoke is one of the two places the
 * MCP Apps sandbox is genuinely exercised, and the sandbox is built out of the
 * primitives that actually diverge between engines — `srcdoc` CSP inheritance,
 * nested sandboxed iframes, `Permissions-Policy`, cross-frame `postMessage`. See
 * `lib/headless-browser.mjs`, including why a green WebKit run is not a Safari
 * guarantee.
 *
 * Expects `clients/web/dist` and `clients/launcher/build` to be built first —
 * the validate / CI ordering guarantees this. `test-servers/build` is rebuilt on
 * every run, as in smoke:cli — see `scripts/lib/ensure-test-servers.mjs` for why
 * presence isn't freshness. This smoke is the one that found that out: a
 * `v2/main` merge touching `preset-registry.ts` made it report the dedicated
 * app-origin path as broken when it was really driving the pre-merge fixture.
