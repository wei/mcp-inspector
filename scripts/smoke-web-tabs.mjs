/**
 * Headless-browser connected-flow smoke for the core tabs — Tools, Resources,
 * Prompts (#2148).
 *
 * ── What was missing ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The web client had exactly one connected-flow smoke, and it was the Apps tab.
 * `smoke:web:browser` proves the bundle boots and paints; it never connects.
 * `smoke:web:app` / `smoke:web:elicit` connect, but only ever drive the Apps
 * surface. So the three highest-traffic tabs — the ones nearly every session
 * actually uses — were unexercised through the prod bundle end to end.
 *
 * Everything that *did* cover them mocks or bypasses the prod server: unit
 * tests render a screen with fixture props, Storybook play functions do the
 * same in a browser, and the integration project drives `InspectorClient`
 * without a browser at all. A regression living only in the built bundle, or in
 * the prod Hono backend's wiring of a tab, passes all of them. That is the same
 * class `smoke:web:browser` was added for (#1615) and `smoke:web:app` extended
 * (#1859).
 *
 * ── What it drives ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * One server, one browser, one page, three tabs:
 *
 *   1. **Tools** — the list renders, `list_items` is selected and executed, and
 *      the result panel populates *including* its `structuredContent` section.
 *      That last part is the half #1908 fixed: a tool declaring an
 *      `outputSchema` returns its real payload there and the `content[]` blocks
 *      only summarize it, so a result panel that renders text alone looks
 *      correct while dropping the data.
 *   2. **Resources** — the list renders, a resource is read, and the preview
 *      populates. Templates are asserted present (the RFC 6570 fixture, #1919),
 *      which is what proves `resources/templates/list` reached the screen —
 *      that list is fetched by a *different* call than `resources/list` and can
 *      fail on its own.
 *   3. **Prompts** — the list renders and `simple_prompt` is fetched (selecting
 *      an argument-less prompt auto-fetches), and the messages render.
 *
 * Deliberately **one script over one browser launch** rather than one per tab:
 * launching the browser and booting the server dominate the cost, and
 * `npm run ci` is already several minutes. Measured added wall-clock is ~5s
 * on a warm checkout (macOS, Chromium), the test-server build included.
 *
 * ── What it asserts on ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `data-*` attributes, never copy. Each screen carries a readiness contract
 * mirroring the `data-app-status` precedent — `data-testid="tools-screen"` with
 * `data-tool-count` / `data-call-status`, and the Resources / Prompts
 * equivalents. See clients/web/README.md#core-tab-automation-contract. A smoke
 * that waited on visible text would fail the next time a label is reworded,
 * which is noise rather than signal.
 *
 * The connect half is `lib/deep-link-connect.mjs`, shared with every other
 * browser smoke — see that header for why a copied deep link fails as an opaque
 * timeout rather than a mismatch.
 *
 * ── Scope ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Chromium only, and not in `ENGINE_SMOKES`.** The engine tiers exist for the
 * MCP Apps sandbox, which is built out of the primitives that genuinely diverge
 * between engines (`srcdoc` CSP inheritance, nested sandboxed iframes,
 * cross-frame `postMessage`). These three tabs are ordinary React and Mantine;
 * running them a second time under Firefox would double their cost for
 * coverage that is not engine-sensitive. Cross-engine parameterization is
 * #2031's third bullet and is tracked separately.
 *
 * The deeper tabs — Network, Protocol, Logs, Tasks — are **not** covered here.
 * Each needs its own server config and more waiting, and #2148 explicitly
 * allows splitting. They remain unsmoked; that is a stated gap, not an
 * oversight.
 *
 * Expects `clients/web/dist` and `clients/launcher/build` to be built first —
 * the validate / CI ordering guarantees this. `test-servers/build` is rebuilt on
 * every run; see `scripts/lib/ensure-test-servers.mjs` for why presence is not
 * freshness (#2111).
