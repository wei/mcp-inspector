/**
 * Headless-browser smoke for app-rendered form elicitations (#1854).
 *
 * `smoke:web:app` proves an App *tool* renders. This proves the other thing an
 * MCP App can now do: answer a server's `elicitation/create`. It drives the
 * whole negotiated chain end to end against the public fixture —
 * **connect → call the tool → server elicits → app renders in the sandbox →
 * user clicks → the app's standard `ElicitResult` reaches the server** — and
 * then drives the SAME tool against a server that did NOT advertise the nested
 * MCP Apps `elicitation` capability, which must fall back to the Inspector's
 * native elicitation form.
 *
 * The fallback half is the more valuable of the two. The failure mode this
 * feature can produce is not "the app doesn't render" (loud, obvious) but
 * "an app renders when it should not have been offered one" — a client that
 * over-claims the capability strands every user of a server that never opted
 * in. Asserting the native form appears is what pins that.
 *
 * Two nested frames matter here: the outer trusted sandbox-proxy iframe and the
 * inner sandboxed iframe holding the untrusted app. Clicking the app's button
 * therefore needs `frameLocator(...).frameLocator(...)`, not one hop.
 *
 * Set `SMOKE_SCREENSHOT_DIR` to capture PNGs of each state (used to attach
 * proof to a PR); unset, it asserts only.
 *
 * `SMOKE_BROWSER` picks the engine (`chromium` — the default — `firefox`, or
 * `webkit`). Three tiers, deliberately (#2086):
 *
 *   - **GitHub CI** runs this smoke in **Chromium** only.
 *   - **`npm run ci`**, the local pre-push gate, runs it in **Chromium and
 *     Firefox** — the Firefox pass is `smoke:web:firefox`, and it is the one
 *     gate step with no GitHub CI counterpart.
 *   - **WebKit is on demand only**: `SMOKE_BROWSER=webkit npm run smoke:web:elicit`
 *     for this smoke alone, or `npm run smoke:web:webkit` for all three.
 *
 * Firefox passes. WebKit fails this smoke for reasons nobody has identified and
 * nobody is investigating: it does not reproduce in real Safari, and an isolated
 * SSE repro did not reproduce it under Playwright's WebKit either, so it reads
 * as a property of that build rather than a browser bug. Do not read a WebKit
 * failure here as a defect until someone has actually looked.
 *
 * Along with `smoke:web:app` this is one
 * of the two places the MCP Apps sandbox is actually loaded, and the two nested
 * frames below are precisely the surface that diverges between engines. See
 * `lib/headless-browser.mjs`, including why a green WebKit run is not a Safari
 * guarantee.
 *
 * Expects `clients/web/dist` and `clients/launcher/build` to be built first.
 * `test-servers/build` is rebuilt on every run, as in smoke:web:app — see
 * `scripts/lib/ensure-test-servers.mjs` for why presence isn't freshness.
