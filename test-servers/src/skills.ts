/**
 * Skills extension test fixture — SEP-2640 (`io.modelcontextprotocol/skills`).
 *
 * Serves `skills/list` (paginated), `skills/get` and
 * `resources/directory/read`, plus `resources/read` for the `skill://` URIs
 * those entries name, so an Inspector connected here can exercise the whole
 * flow: enumerate, descend the tree, fetch a file, and verify its digest.
 *
 * **The awkward skills are the point.** A fixture that only served a clean
 * skill would leave every verification and conformance path in the Inspector
 * untestable, so the set below deliberately includes three edge cases — each
 * the exact shape one of the checks in `core/mcp/skills.ts` exists to catch:
 *
 *  - `dynamic-report` declares `resources: "dynamic"`. That is a **conforming**
 *    wire form for generated content, not a violation; what it costs is that
 *    integrity cannot be verified at all, which the Inspector reports as a
 *    warning. It is here because "legal but unverifiable" is the case most
 *    easily buried.
 *  - `tampered-notes` advertises a digest that does not match the bytes it
 *    serves — a genuine violation.
 *  - `wrong-folder` has a URI path segment that disagrees with
 *    `frontmatter.name` — the other genuine violation.
 *  - `stale-manifest` serves — and directory-lists — a file its `resources`
 *    manifest does not declare. SEP-2640 calls a directory result "a live
 *    observation" and says hosts MUST NOT treat it as extending the manifest,
 *    so this is the fixture for that rule: the Inspector must show the extra
 *    child as *not listed* rather than as one of the skill's files (#2248).
 *  - `acme/reports` and `globex/reports` collide on `frontmatter.name`. Both
 *    are **fully conforming** — SEP-2640 requires only that the segment before
 *    `/SKILL.md` equal the name, which multi-segment paths satisfy while still
 *    sharing a final segment, and the SEP's own `acme/billing/refunds` example
 *    is this shape. The obligation is on the *consumer*: hosts MUST NOT assume
 *    name uniqueness and MUST tell two same-named skills apart rather than
 *    collapsing or preferring one. This pair is also the only fixture with a
 *    multi-segment skill path, which nothing else here exercises (#2248).
 *  - `lying-listing` advertises one `description` in its `skills/list` entry
 *    and serves a different one in its `SKILL.md` — the violation no digest can
 *    catch, because the digest is over the bytes the server served and says
 *    nothing about whether the *listing* described them honestly (#2248). It is
 *    the only fixture whose `SKILL.md` is deliberately NOT derived from its
 *    listed frontmatter, and the exception is what makes the frontmatter
 *    cross-check demonstrable at all.
 *
 * `skills/list` and `skills/get` are registered through the **public**
 * `setRequestHandler`, which accepts a consumer-owned method name as long as
 * explicit schemas are supplied — no private-field escape hatch, and the params
 * are validated on the way in. That is the difference from `modern-tasks.ts`:
 * `tasks/*` are spec names the 2026 codec deleted, so they need the raw seam;
 * `skills/*` are in neither codec, which makes them era-blind in both
 * directions and lets one fixture serve both the legacy and modern legs.
 *
 * `resources/read` is the one exception, and it is a *wrap* rather than a
 * registration: the fixture must answer `skill://` URIs while leaving every
 * other URI to the SDK's own handler, and `setRequestHandler` replaces a
 * handler instead of chaining onto it. There is no public "extend this method"
 * API, so the existing handler is captured and delegated to.
