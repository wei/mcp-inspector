Issues are how work reaches the Inspector — we accept issues, not pull
requests. See CONTRIBUTORS.md for the full policy.

Just tick the version below — a maintainer applies the `v1` / `v2` label
during triage (most reporters can't set labels themselves). When in doubt,
it's v2.

Please don't attach a diff or open a PR. Share the *prompt* you used to
produce the change, plus what you verified — we'll reproduce it through our
own workflow so it lands with the right conventions, tests, and coverage.
