description: Run, place and fix tests in this repo. Use when choosing which npm command runs a given suite (web unit, web integration, Storybook, cli, tui, launcher, scripts); when deciding where a new test file belongs — beside its source, under src/test/, or in a client's __tests__/; when a per-file coverage check fails or a v8 ignore is in question; when asking which test tier spawns the built binary rather than importing it; or when rendering, mounting or asserting on Mantine components and their transitions in a test.

# Testing

**Every change needs tests, and every file must clear ≥90% on lines,
statements, functions, and branches.** That rule and the React/Mantine
conventions live in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md); this skill is where a
test goes, how to run it, and how to clear the gate.

## Before you write it: does the test use a `test-servers/` fixture?

**If it does, load the `test-servers` skill now — that is step one, before
choosing a location or writing a line.**

The condition is **"does this test depend on a fixture from `test-servers/`?"**
— not which tier it lands in, and not which directory it lands in. There are two
ways to depend on one, and they need different halves of that skill:

- **It connects to a fixture.** An integration test that connects; an
  end-to-end test that connects; a smoke that drives a connected flow; a
  coverage gap only reachable over a real connection; reproducing a reported bug
  against a server. These need the whole procedure — the staleness hazard, and
  then whichever half matches how the server is stood up.
  ⚠️ **Which shape you need depends on what is driving, and there are three.**
  All three are the **"Three ways to use a fixture"** section of `test-servers`,
  which names the entry point and a reference for each — read the right third:
  - **An integration or CLI test → in-process HTTP.**
    `createTestServerHttp(...)` / `.start()` / `.stop()`, with the test owning
    the lifecycle. Use it when the case needs HTTP or SSE, a specific tool set,
    or the modern handler (`modern: {}` is a constructor option). **No showcase
    config and no era table apply.**
  - **An integration or CLI test where stdio is the point → spawned stdio.**
    `getTestMcpServerCommand()` handed to a stdio transport or to the built CLI,
    which spawns it. A subprocess *is* started, but it runs the stdio fixture's
    **default** config, so there is still nothing to pick — and nothing to
    override, so if the case needs a specific tool set it is an in-process HTTP
    test instead.
  - **A config-driven web smoke, or `pack:verify` → spawned composable HTTP.**
    `smoke:web:elicitation`, `smoke:web:app`, `smoke:web:tabs` and `pack:verify`
    all spawn `server-composable.js --config <name>.json`. **The showcase-config
    and protocol-era guidance applies to you in full** — being automated does
    not exempt a smoke from it.

  ⚠️ **"A smoke" is not a shape, so do not route by that word.** `smoke:cli`
  uses the first two — an in-process `createTestServerHttp` for the header
  round-trip, and the built stdio entry in a `--catalog` for the connect checks
  — and `smoke:tui` uses the stdio entry alone. Only the web smokes above are
  config-driven. Pick by what the caller actually stands up.

  What applies to all three is that section's build warning.
  ⚠️ **Connecting is a strong hint, not the rule.** A few integration tests
  deliberately hand-roll a JSON-RPC server because the composable fixture
  *cannot* produce what they assert on — `inspectorClient-malformed-list.test.ts`
  and `listSalvage-era.test.ts` need wire shapes the SDK's own server refuses to
  emit. Real transport, real client, no `test-servers/` dependency. Check
  whether a fixture can express the case before reaching for one.
- **It names or runs the built fixture without connecting.** `smoke:tui` boots
  the TUI against a catalog whose stdio command *is* the built fixture, then
  asserts it survives. No transport is driven and no protocol era applies, but
  the **build and staleness** half lands on it in full.

⚠️ **"A build ran" is not the dependency — using the artefact is.**
`clients/web`'s `pretest` runs `test-servers:build` before *every* unit run, so
the fixture is on disk for tests that never reference it. What counts is whether
the test **starts, spawns, configures, or hands a built entry to the subject
under test**. That last clause is what covers `smoke:tui`, which drives no
transport at all and still depends on the fixture — see the build-only bullet
above.

⚠️ **And *importing* the package is not the dependency either.** The barrel
exports plain functions as well as server factories, so a test can import from
it and never stand a server up — `src/test/core/mcp/test-server-scope.test.ts`
imports `createScopeCheckMiddleware` and friends to unit-test the scope
middleware as a pure function, with no `start()` anywhere in the file. None of
the procedure applies to it — no config, no era, no lifecycle — it is an
ordinary unit test that happens to import its subject from that package. Ask
whether a *server* runs, not whether the import line is present.

So the condition does **not** hold when the test renders a component from
fixture props, exercises a pure function or a parser, or is a smoke that touches
no fixture — `smoke:launcher` checks `--help`, and `smoke:web` /
`smoke:web:browser` only assert the SPA is served and paints.

⚠️ **Neither the tier nor the folder decides this.** `src/test/integration/`
holds `storage/store-id.test.ts`, which validates a string, and `mcp/import/*`,
which parses config files, right beside the tests that drive a live connection.
They sit there for the node env and the 30s timeout, not because they connect —
placement is the project manifest, so it cannot also be the fixture trigger.
Ask what the test *does*, not where it lives.

**In the connecting case**, the test drives a **real server over a real
transport, never a mock**, and picking the fixture, building it, and connecting
with the right protocol era is a procedure this skill does not carry. Writing
one without `test-servers` means hand-rolling a fixture that already exists, or
mocking the thing the tier exists to avoid mocking. **In the build-only case**,
none of the transport or protocol-era guidance applies — what you need from
`test-servers` is how to build the fixture and why a stale build keeps serving
old code.

## Where the test file goes

**Side-by-side by default; `src/test/` only for what can't be co-located; and
the Node clients are different.**

### `clients/web` — side-by-side

`<Name>.test.tsx` (or `.test.ts` for non-React modules) **next to the source**.
Components, hooks, `lib/`, `utils/`. This is the overwhelming majority; a
web-owned test living under `src/test/` instead is a bug.

`clients/web/src/test/` is for the three things that *cannot* be co-located:

1. **Tests of the repo-root `core/` package** → `src/test/core/…`, mirroring the
   `core/` folder layout. `core/` physically lives outside `clients/web/`, is
   consumed via the `@inspector/core` alias, and has no test harness of its own.
   This includes `core/json/*` and `core/client/*`.
2. **The `integration` project** → `src/test/integration/…`, mirroring the
   `core/` source layout (`mcp/`, `mcp/node/`, `mcp/remote/`, `auth/`,
   `auth/node/`, `storage/`). **Placement is the manifest** — any file under that
   folder is picked up by the integration project (node env, 30s timeouts) via a
   folder glob; there is no enumeration to keep in sync. ⚠️ Placement is *not*
   the fixture trigger, though — this folder holds pure parser and storage tests
   alongside the connecting ones. If the test you are adding here **needs a
   fixture from `test-servers/`, load that skill first**; the fixture is half of
   that test. Connecting is a strong hint but not the rule — see the
   hand-rolled-server exception above.
3. **Shared test infrastructure** — `renderWithMantine.tsx`, `setup.ts`,
   `fixtures/`, `scrollAreaStoryAssertions.ts`.

### `clients/cli`, `clients/tui`, `clients/launcher` — a top-level `__tests__/`

**All** their tests, not beside their source. Their `tsconfig.json` excludes
`**/*.test.*` and their `tsconfig.test.json` includes `__tests__/**/*`, so a
co-located `src/**/*.test.*` lands in **no** tsconfig project and fails
`npm run verify:typecheck-coverage` (#1791).

### Root tooling — `scripts/*.test.mjs`

A new `scripts/*.mjs` helper with pure logic gets a sibling `*.test.mjs`, run by
`npm run test:scripts` (node's built-in runner; the root has no vitest harness by
design). ⚠️ Keep the filename `*.test.mjs` — `node --test` silently **skips** a
file its glob misses and still exits 0.

## Running them

| Scope | From | Command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web unit | `clients/web` | `npm run test` (`test:watch` while iterating) |
| Web integration | `clients/web` | `npm run test:integration` |
| Web Storybook play fns | `clients/web` | `npm run test:storybook` |
| CLI | `clients/cli` | `npm run test` (`pretest` builds test-servers + the bin) |
| TUI | `clients/tui` | `npm run test` |
| Launcher | `clients/launcher` | `npm run test` |
| Root tooling | repo root | `npm run test:scripts` |
| Everything, fast | repo root | `npm run validate` |
| The coverage gate | repo root | `npm run coverage` |

There is **no aggregate root `test` script** — each client self-validates.

In unit tests that expect error output, **suppress it from the console**.

## The tiers, shallowest first

unit (`test`, per client) → web integration (`test:integration`, real
transports/servers) → out-of-process (`clients/cli/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`,
spawns the built binary) → smokes through the built launcher (`npm run smoke`) →
Storybook play functions (`test:storybook`) → the published-tarball check
(`npm run pack:verify`, local/release only — needs network).

⚠️ **Depth in that list is not the fixture boundary, and the boundary cuts
across the tiers rather than along them.** Needing `test-servers/`: the web
integration tests **that drive one**, the out-of-process CLI tests, the smokes
that connect (`smoke:cli`, `smoke:web:app`, `smoke:web:elicit`,
`smoke:web:tabs`), `pack:verify`, and **`smoke:tui`** — which never asserts a
round trip but calls `ensureTestServers({ requires: ["stdio"] })` and hands the
built fixture to the TUI as its catalog's stdio command. Not needing it: the
pure tests inside the same integration project, the connecting tests that
deliberately hand-roll a server, `smoke:launcher`, `smoke:web` and
`smoke:web:browser` (all three stop at boot without a fixture), and every
Storybook play function (fixture props). **Load the `test-servers` skill as soon
as a task puts you on the fixture side of that line** — whichever tier it sits
in.

`validate` runs the per-client `test` scripts — so web **unit** plus cli's
out-of-process `e2e.test.ts`, but **not** web's integration project, which runs
inside the `coverage` gate. CI therefore has no separate `test:integration` step.

## The coverage gate

**Per-file ≥90 on all four dimensions**, CI-enforced, across web, cli, tui and
launcher. New code must clear 90 on every dimension.

Scope notes:

- The **web** coverage `include` (in `clients/web/vite.config.ts`) also covers
  the shared `core/` runtime the browser consumes — `core/mcp`, `core/react`,
  `core/auth`, `core/storage`, `core/logging`, `core/node`, `core/json`,
  `core/client`.
- ⚠️ That `include` is a **whitelist** naming `components`/`hooks`/`theme`/
  `lib`/`utils`/`server`. A module placed **outside** those directories falls out
  of the gate entirely, silently. The documented exceptions are `src/App.tsx`
  (a composition root at ~42% branch coverage — gating it is a dedicated
  decomposition effort) and the `src/main.tsx` / `src/index.ts` bootstraps.
- **CLI** tests run **in-process** by importing `runCli()`
  (`__tests__/helpers/cli-runner.ts`) so `src` is measured; `src/index.ts` is the
  only exclusion. `commander` uses `.exitOverride()` so a parse error throws
  instead of tearing down the test worker.
- **TUI** covers **all of `src/**`, React surface included**. Components mount
  through `__tests__/helpers/renderTui.tsx` — `ink-testing-library`'s `render`
  with every frame ANSI-stripped — alongside the passthrough doubles in the same
  directory; keypresses are driven through stdin. The only exclusion is
  `src/tui-servers.ts` (a pure re-export, excluded so it doesn't surface as a
  misleading 0/0 row).
  ⚠️ **Import `render` from that helper, not from `ink-testing-library`.** Ink
  writes styling *inside* the styled run, so `<Text underline>I</Text>nfo`
  reaches the frame buffer with escapes between `I` and `nfo` and a plain
  `toContain("Info")` fails against a component that is rendering correctly. It
  only shows up where chalk emits color — a developer whose shell exports
  `FORCE_COLOR` — so CI, which has no TTY, stays green on a suite that is red
  for them (#2207). If a frame assertion fails on a string you can plainly see
  in the printed diff, that is the tell. Reach `stdout.lastFrame()` on the
  returned instance for the raw bytes.

### When a `v8 ignore` is justified

A genuinely-unreachable branch is annotated at the source rather than waved
through by lowering the gate. The acceptable reasons are enumerated in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) — do not reach for one that is not on that
list.

## React tests: `renderWithMantine`

**Always render through `renderWithMantine`** (`src/test/renderWithMantine.tsx`)
— it wraps in `MantineProvider` with the project theme. Do not hand-roll a bare
`MantineProvider`; it skips the project theme and the helper's options and drifts
from every other test.

Note the justification has changed and the old one is wrong: it sets
`env="test"`, which makes Mantine skip the animated **render** — but it does
**not** stop the timers. `env` is read only at `Transition.mjs`'s render branch,
while `useTransition()` runs before that check and still schedules real
`window.setTimeout`s (opening a `<Modal>` schedules three 200ms timers). What
prevents a timer outliving its file — and throwing an uncaught
`ReferenceError: window is not defined` that fails the **whole run**, attributed
to an innocent file (#1760) — is the **leaked-timer safety net in
`src/test/setup.ts`**, which is global and covers every unit test however it
renders. The rule stands on consistency, not on timer safety.

- **Forced color scheme:** pass the option —
  `renderWithMantine(ui, { colorScheme: "dark" })` — rather than hand-rolling
  `defaultColorScheme="dark"`.
- **Mid-flight transition state** (e.g. asserting a `data-anim="out"` cell during
  an exit crossfade) is the only reason to use `renderWithMantineTransitions`.
  Pass `settleMs` derived from the component's real animation duration **plus
  the helper's shared slack** — `HEADER_ANIM_MS + RAF_SLACK_MS`, both imported,
  never a literal: the first term tracks the component and the second tracks how
  busy the machine is, and only the second should move when the machine gets
  busier (#2323). Do **not** also use `vi.useFakeTimers()` in that test:
  the auto-settle awaits a real `setTimeout`, so under fake timers it **throws**
  with a message telling you to call `vi.useRealTimers()` first — it does not
  silently skip. That is deliberate (a deadlock would otherwise hang until the
  project's `hookTimeout`), but it means the combination fails the test rather
  than degrading. If the test unmounts the tree
  itself use the `unmount()` the helper returns. The mechanism is documented at
  length on the helper — read there before changing it.

## Storybook play functions

Every screen and element component has a `*.stories.tsx`; play functions double
as interaction tests, run headless in CI and in the local gate.

⚠️ **`expect(...)` from `storybook/test` returns a promise.** Storybook
instruments it, so every `expect` in a play function is awaited — as is any
shared helper that wraps one.

## Test servers, not mocks

The tests that drive MCP behaviour over a transport use a real server rather
than a mock, and **for the ones that get that server from `test-servers/`, load
the skill and use all of it**: which showcase config covers the feature, which
protocol era to connect with, how to add a combination that does not exist yet,
and why a fixture can keep serving stale code after an edit.

**A test that only *names* the built fixture needs that skill too, for a
narrower reason.** `smoke:tui` boots the TUI against a catalog whose stdio
command is the build output and asserts it survives — it opens no transport, so
config choice and protocol era do not apply to it, but **building the fixture
and the staleness hazard do.** Load the skill and take that half.

A pure test that happens to live in the integration project, and a smoke that
references no fixture, need neither (see the tier list above) — and note that
`clients/web`'s `pretest` builds `test-servers/` before every unit run, so its
presence on disk says nothing about whether your test depends on it.
