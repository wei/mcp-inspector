# PR flow

Rules this procedure enforces live in [`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md)
(Issue-driven Work Style, Contributing). Board mechanics are in `/board-ops`;
the gate itself is `/pre-push-gate`.

**Pull requests against this repo are opened by the repo maintainers only.**
Having write access is not authorization to open one — anyone else files a
detailed issue and a maintainer takes it from there.

## 1. Start from an issue

**Every PR references an issue. No exceptions, regardless of who opens it.** A
PR with no linked issue has no board card, so the work is invisible to the
project board and untracked. If there's no issue yet, create one first with
`/issue-create` — don't open the PR and backfill.

Move the issue's card to **In Progress** (`/board-ops`).

## 2. Branch

**Branch names start with the target version segment** — the first path segment
is the version whose base branch the PR targets, then the type, then a slug:

```
v2/fix/2071-oauth-resource-metadata
v2/chore/2146-rename-local-gate
v1/fix/proxy-ssrf-pin
```

Not `fix/oauth-resource-metadata`. This keeps the two lines legible in
`git branch -a` and in the PR list once v1 and v2 branches coexist on the same
remote, and it matches the base branches themselves (`v2/main`, `v1/main`).

**Cut the branch from the base it will target** — `v2/main` for v2 work,
`v1/main` for v1. The two lines have unrelated histories, so a `v1/fix/…`
branch cut from `v2/main` arrives at `v1/main` carrying the whole v2 tree
(Copilot). And never cut from a milestone-merge branch — it carries release-only
commits that will show up in your PR's diff.

Working in a git worktree is fine and often preferable. ⚠️ **A worktree needs a
real `npm install`, not a symlinked `node_modules`** — a symlink passes
lint/test/coverage and then fails all Storybook story files on Vite's
`fs.allow`.

For order-dependent PRs on one issue, **stack** them: each branch is based on the
previous one, not all cut from `v2/main`.

## 3. Sign off every commit

**The DCO check is a hard merge gate.** The [probot DCO
app](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) fails the PR unless each commit carries
a `Signed-off-by: Name <email>` trailer whose name **and** email match either the
commit's author or its committer. Its only exemptions are merge commits and
bot-authored commits; there is no partial credit — one unsigned commit out of six
fails the whole check.

**Prevent it with `git commit -s`.** Two things that look like automation and are
not:

- ⚠️ **`git config format.signOff true` does nothing here.** Despite the name it
  only defaults the `-s` flag for `git format-patch`; `git commit` never reads it,
  and there is no `commit.signoff` equivalent.
- ⚠️ **A `prepare-commit-msg` hook works, but think before installing one.** The
  trailer is a certification, and a hook makes it on your behalf for *every*
  commit, including work you merely cherry-picked. Inside that hook,
  `git var GIT_AUTHOR_IDENT` returns your config identity rather than the
  preserved author, so it cannot even tell it is signing for someone else.

**Repairing already-pushed commits** means rewriting them:

```sh
git rebase HEAD~<n> --signoff
git push --force-with-lease
```

Use `--force-with-lease` rather than `--force`, and only rewrite when you are the
sole author and nobody else has based work on the branch. The two apparent
alternatives are not alternatives: the app's empty "remediation commit" flow
requires `allowRemediationCommits.individual` and this repo ships no
`.github/dco.yml`, so it runs disabled; and the override button anyone with write
access sees only silences the check without anyone certifying anything.

The signoff is a [Developer Certificate of
Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) assertion made in **your own name**. It
does not claim you wrote the code, so signing off a cherry-pick is legitimate.
What is never acceptable is fabricating *someone else's* certification.

## 4. Run the gate

`npm run format`, then `npm run local:gate`. See `/pre-push-gate` — `npm run
validate` is **not** a substitute.

## 5. Screenshots, for any UI change

Any change to the web UI or the TUI must show its result: capture before/after
screenshots (or a short GIF for an interaction) into a **`pr-screenshots/`
folder off the repo root**, creating it if it doesn't exist. That folder is
**gitignored** — the images are working artifacts staged for upload, never
committed — so attach them to the PR body from there rather than referencing an
in-repo path. Name them for what they show (`tools-tab-before.png`), not
`Screenshot 2026-07-31 at 14.02.11.png`.

To host them, upload to GitHub's attachment endpoint with your `gh` token; the
parameters go in the **query string** with the raw bytes as the body (a JSON
body fails with a misleading "Invalid name for request"):

```sh
curl -sX POST -H "Authorization: token $(gh auth token)" \
  --data-binary @pr-screenshots/tools-tab-after.png \
  "https://uploads.github.com/user-attachments/assets?repository_id=<REPO_ID>&name=tools-tab-after.png&content_type=image/png"
```

## 6. Open the PR

Target the base branch matching the work: **`v2/main`** for v2, **`v1/main`**
for v1. Never `main`.

The body's **first line is `Closes #<ISSUE_NUMBER>`**.

```sh
gh pr create --repo modelcontextprotocol/inspector \
  --base v2/main --label v2 \
  --title "<title>" --body "Closes #<N>

<what changed and why>"
```

⚠️ Closing keywords only auto-link and auto-close for PRs targeting the repo's
**default branch** (`main`). Because v2 PRs target `v2/main`, `Closes #N` there
is only a cross-reference — it will **not** create a hard link or close the issue
on merge. Keep it anyway, so the issues close if/when `v2/main` reaches `main`.
There is no `gh` flag for manual linking; closing keywords are the only
mechanism GitHub exposes.

Move the card to **In Review**.

## 7. Request a Copilot review

Only the GraphQL `requestReviews` mutation with the Copilot **bot id** works —
REST, `gh pr edit --add-reviewer`, `userIds`, and `copilot-swe-agent` all fail or
silently drop.

```sh
PR_ID=$(gh pr view <N> --repo modelcontextprotocol/inspector --json id --jq .id)
gh api graphql -f query='
  mutation($pr:ID!,$bot:[ID!]!) {
    requestReviews(input:{pullRequestId:$pr, botIds:$bot, union:true}) {
      pullRequest { id }
    }
  }' -f pr="$PR_ID" -f bot='BOT_kgDOCnlnWA'
```

Poll for the review with a `startswith` match — the review login carries a
`[bot]` suffix.

## 8. Respond to the review

- It is **not** necessary to implement every suggestion. Implementing one a
  different way, or declining it with a reason, is fine.
- After making the changes, **respond to each comment** with what was done, or
  why it was ignored.
- ⚠️ **Inline replies go hidden once the fix is pushed** (the threads become
  outdated), so **mirror each round at PR level** as a summary comment, and always
  read the "Suppressed comments" block.
- ⚠️ **Copilot's inline comments lag its review body.** The body's "generated N
  comments" count lands first; fetch by recency and reconcile. Repeated
  re-review silence means the session ended.

## 9. Merge and close out

**On merge of a v2 PR, manually close its issue and move the board item to
Done**, since auto-close won't fire on `v2/main`. Use the move-a-card recipe in
`/board-ops` — the option IDs are unstable, so this file names the column and
nothing else.

`Done` is only for work that **shipped** — a merged PR, or a parent whose last
sub-issue closed. Anything else (duplicate, won't fix, not planned, obsolete)
means nothing shipped, so **delete the card** instead; see `/board-ops`.
