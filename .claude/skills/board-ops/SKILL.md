description: gh recipes for the Inspector project boards — add a card, move its Status, set or re-score its Priority, delete a card, and recover from a deleted single-select option. Covers board #28 (v2) and board #11 (v1), their node/field/option IDs, and the option-deletion hazard.

# Board operations

The rules about *what* a card's Status and Priority should be live in
[`AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) under **Issue-driven Work Style**. This skill is
the *mechanics*: the exact `gh` calls, the IDs, and the ways the board can be
damaged.

Related: `/issue-create` (the five-step create flow), `/issue-triage` (sweeping
unboarded issues in, the priority rubric, the board audit).

## Which board

| Version label | Board | Owner | Has a Priority field? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `v2` | [#28](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/28) | `modelcontextprotocol` | Yes |
| `v1` | [#11](https://github.com/orgs/modelcontextprotocol/projects/11) | `modelcontextprotocol` | **No** |

Both are **org** projects, so every command takes `--owner modelcontextprotocol`.
The two projects have their own field and option IDs and none of them are
interchangeable — a #28 id passed to #11 is rejected with "option Id does not
belong to the field", so the mistake is at least loud.

**Only issues go on a board — never PRs, never draft cards.** A PR is tracked
through the card of the issue it closes.

## V2 board (#28) IDs

The project node id and the field ids are stable. The **option** ids are **not** —
they are regenerated whenever a single-select field's option list is edited (see
the hazard below). If any option id here is rejected, re-fetch:

```sh
# Swap "Status" for "Priority" to fetch the other field's options.
gh project field-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json \
  | jq '.fields[] | select(.name=="Status") | .options'
```

| Thing | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Project node ID | `PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt` |
| Status field ID | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c` |
| Priority field ID | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4` |

Status option IDs (`--single-select-option-id`) — **last verified 2026-08-01**.

| Status | Option ID | Means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Incoming | `721a3d4c` | Arrived unboarded, awaiting review — **no milestone** |
| Todo | `fbdaf21e` | Approved (a milestone was assigned) |
| In Progress | `195df262` | Active work, whatever the surface |
| In Review | `159c8a02` | A PR is open |
| Done | `259d6aab` | **Shipped** — a merged PR, or a parent whose last sub-issue closed |

Priority option IDs — **last verified 2026-08-01**. Derive the level with the
rubric in `/issue-triage`; don't eyeball it.

| Priority | Option ID | Rubric total |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Urgent | `79628723` | 12+ |
| High | `0a877460` | 9–11 |
| Medium | `da944a9c` | 6–8 |
| Low | `d67ac7ce` | ≤5 |

## V1 board (#11) IDs

The v1 line takes security fixes only, so this board sees little traffic — but a
v1 issue still gets a card, and the same Incoming/Todo split applies.

| Thing | ID |
| --- | --- |
| Project node ID | `PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BA5sz` |
| Status field ID | `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BA5szzgzkS-g` |

Status option IDs — **last verified 2026-08-01**.

| Status | Option ID |
| --- | --- |
| Incoming | `831820cf` |
| Todo | `f75ad846` |
| In Progress | `47fc9ee4` |
| In Review | `0439b2bf` |
| Done | `98236657` |

There is **no Priority field on this board** — the priority rubric is v2-only.
Don't try to set one here; the field id doesn't exist.

## Recipes

### Add a card and set its fields

```sh
# Prints the item id (PVTI_…); capture it.
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json --jq '.id')

# Status → Todo (an issue you filed through the create flow is approved by definition)
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id fbdaf21e

# Priority → Medium
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4 --single-select-option-id da944a9c
```

Each `item-edit` sets **one** field, so setting both takes two calls — there is
no combined form.

For an issue swept in at triage, the only difference is Status → **Incoming**
(`721a3d4c`) and that you do **not** set a milestone.

For **v1**, the same shape against board #11:

```sh
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-add 11 --owner modelcontextprotocol --url <issue-url> --format json --jq '.id')
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BA5sz --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BA5szzgzkS-g --single-select-option-id f75ad846
```

### Move an existing card

Look the item id up by issue number rather than re-adding it. Keep `--limit`
above the board's item count (~265 as of 2026-08-01) — past it `item-list`
truncates **silently**, `select` matches nothing, and `item-edit --id ""` fails
with an opaque node-resolution error rather than saying the limit was too low.

⚠️ **Filter by repository, not by number alone.** These are **org** projects and
issue numbers are **repo-local**, so an unfiltered `select` can match another
repo's issue that happens to share the number — board #11 really does carry a
`modelcontextprotocol/servers` card — and then moves or deletes the wrong card,
or passes two ids at once (Copilot).

```sh
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 500 \
  --jq '.items[] | select(.content.repository=="modelcontextprotocol/inspector"
                          and .content.number==<ISSUE_NUMBER>) | .id')
# e.g. Status → In Review, when its PR opens
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$ITEM_ID" \
  --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id 159c8a02
```

### Delete a card

**`Done` means the work shipped.** An issue closed as duplicate / won't fix /
not planned / obsolete / superseded shipped nothing, so its card is **deleted**,
not parked in Done:

```sh
ITEM_ID=$(gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 500 \
  --jq '.items[] | select(.content.repository=="modelcontextprotocol/inspector"
                          and .content.number==<ISSUE_NUMBER>) | .id')
gh project item-delete 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --id "$ITEM_ID"
```

Deleting the card removes it from the board only — **the issue itself is
untouched**, keeps its labels and comments, and stays searchable and linkable
forever. Nothing is lost; the board simply stops claiming the work was
delivered. Done is read as the record of what a milestone actually delivered, so
a duplicate sitting there makes that record wrong in a way nobody can detect
later.

The close **reason** is the machine-readable form of the same distinction.
`gh issue close --reason` accepts only `completed` and `not planned`, so
**`duplicate` must be set through the API**:

```sh
gh api repos/modelcontextprotocol/inspector/issues/<N> -X PATCH \
  -f state=closed -f state_reason=duplicate
```

(or "Mark as duplicate" in the web UI, which additionally records a
duplicate-of link).

## ⚠️ The option-deletion hazard

**Never add, rename, or remove an option on a single-select board field (Status
or Priority) with the `updateProjectV2Field` GraphQL mutation unless you pass
every existing option's `id`.** That mutation does a **full replace** of the
option list: resending options by name/color/description without their `id`s
makes GitHub **delete all existing options and mint new ones**, which **orphans
that field's value on every card on the board** *and* invalidates every option
id in the tables above. This has happened once, on Status (~197 items
reconstructed by inference).

Safe alternatives, in order of preference:

1. **Add or rename an option in the GitHub web UI** (Project → the field's
   settings). This preserves the ids of untouched options.
   ⚠️ **Deleting is different, in the UI as much as in the API**: removing an
   option blanks that field's value on every card that held it, with no undo and
   no warning that says so.
2. If you must script it, first `gh api graphql` the current options **with their
   `id`s**, then call `updateProjectV2Field` echoing back every existing option
   **including its `id`**, appending only the new one.
   `ProjectV2SingleSelectFieldOptionInput.id` is an optional `String`, so a mixed
   list works. Verify afterward that no card lost its value — snapshot
   `gh project item-list … --format json` before and after and diff; don't just
   spot-check. Send those dumps to `$BOARD_TMP` too, for the reason above.

Both the `Incoming` Status option and the Urgent/High/Medium/Low Priority
options were added this way (#1891), with the before/after diff confirming all
264 cards kept their Status.

`gh project item-add` and `gh project item-edit` are always safe — they set a
card's value and never touch the field schema.

### Always snapshot before touching a field's options

One command, and it is the difference between a five-minute restore and
reconstructing statuses by inference:

⚠️ **Write it outside the repo.** [The boards are private](../issue-triage/SKILL.md),
so a snapshot is a full dump of item IDs and every card's Status and Priority.
Left in the working tree it is one `git add -A` away from being published in a
PR (Copilot).

```sh
BOARD_TMP=$(mktemp -d)
gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 600 \
  > "$BOARD_TMP/board-snapshot.json"
echo "snapshot: $BOARD_TMP/board-snapshot.json"   # note the path; you need it to recover
```

### Recovering from a deleted option

This has happened twice — once via the API (~197 items, reconstructed by
inference) and once via the UI (the `Done` column, 247 items, restored from a
snapshot in minutes). With a snapshot the recovery is mechanical.

The recipe below is written for a deleted **Status** option. For a deleted
**Priority** option it is the same three steps with two substitutions: read
`.priority` instead of `.status` (`gh project item-list --format json` exposes
each single-select field under its lowercased name, so both keys are present),
and pass the Priority field id `PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4`.

```sh
# 0. Same temp dir the snapshot went to — keep every dump out of the worktree.
BOARD_TMP=${BOARD_TMP:-$(mktemp -d)}

# 1. Which cards lost their value, and what did they hold?
gh project item-list 28 --owner modelcontextprotocol --format json --limit 600 \
  > "$BOARD_TMP/board-broken.json"
jq -r '[.items[]|select(.status==null)|.id]' "$BOARD_TMP/board-broken.json" \
  > "$BOARD_TMP/lost-ids.json"
jq -r --slurpfile L "$BOARD_TMP/lost-ids.json" '($L[0]) as $lost
  | [.items[] | select(.id as $i | $lost|index($i)) | .status // "(none)"]
  | group_by(.) | map({s:.[0],c:length}) | .[] | "was \(.s): \(.c)"' \
  "$BOARD_TMP/board-snapshot.json"

# 2. Recreate the option, echoing every surviving option's id (see above).
#    NOTE: the recreated option gets a NEW id — the deleted one never comes back.

# 3. Re-apply it to the orphaned cards.
for id in $(jq -r '.[]' "$BOARD_TMP/lost-ids.json"); do
  gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwDOCt2Azc4BJVxt --id "$id" \
    --field-id PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iI8c --single-select-option-id <NEW_OPTION_ID>
  sleep 0.4
done
```

Step 1's grouping is the safety check: confirm the orphaned set is exactly the
cards that held the deleted option, so you don't overwrite a card someone
legitimately moved in the meantime.

Because the recreated option carries a **new id**, the tables above and every
reference to it must be updated in the same change — `grep` the old id across
the repo. The `Done` id has been `248a3910` and is now `259d6aab` for exactly
this reason.

## ⚠️ Two different "Priority" fields

An issue page shows two fields named Priority, and they are unrelated. **Ours is
the one under _Projects → Inspector V2_.**

| Where it appears | What it is | Ours? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Projects → Inspector V2 → Priority** | The **project board** field on #28 (`PVTSSF_lADOCt2Azc4BJVxtzg5iJE4`) | ✅ Yes |
| **Fields → Priority** (above _Projects_) | A GitHub **issue field**, `IFSS_kgDOAdAWeg`, defined at the **org** level and shared by every repo in it | ❌ No |

Nothing syncs them, in either direction, and they will happily disagree.
**Never delete the org-level field** — it belongs to the whole org. Don't set it
either; a value there is a *reporter's* opinion and feeds the rubric as a capped
+1 signal bonus and nothing more (see `/issue-triage`).
