description: Run a composable MCP test server by hand — pick the showcase config for a feature or bug, build it, and connect with the right protocol era. Use when a change, a PR or a smoke test needs a real server to exercise it; when reproducing a reported bug by hand; when choosing which fixture or protocol era to run; when a fixture keeps serving stale code after an edit; or when the config or preset you need does not exist yet.

# Running a test server

`test-servers/` provides **composable MCP servers** so tests and manual checks
exercise a real server over a real transport instead of mocks. A server is
assembled from **presets** (fixture factories in
`test-servers/src/preset-registry.ts`) and configured declaratively with a JSON
file under `test-servers/configs/`.

The full catalogue of showcase configs — one per feature, each with what to click
and what the broken build did — is
[`docs/test-servers.md`](../../../docs/test-servers.md). This skill is how to
run one.

## Three ways to use a fixture — pick the right one first

A fixture is stood up in **one of three shapes**, and most of what follows is
about the third. Establish which one you are in before reading further, because
the showcase **config file and the protocol-era table** belong to that one alone.

⚠️ **The cut is how the server is stood up, not who is driving.** Automated and
by-hand is the wrong axis: the composable-config shape has *both* kinds of
consumer, and a smoke that spawns it needs every bit of the config and era
guidance a person at two terminals does.

| Shape | Server runs | Config file | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **In-process HTTP** | inside the test process, built from the API | none — options are constructor args | integration tests, CLI tests, **`smoke:cli`** |
| **Spawned stdio** | a child process the transport (or the binary under test) starts | none — the stdio fixture runs its default config | integration tests, the CLI suites, **`smoke:cli`**, **`smoke:tui`** |
| **Spawned composable HTTP** | a child process started with `--config` | **yes** — a showcase `--config <name>.json` | the **web** smokes, `pack:verify`, **and** a person by hand |

⚠️ **"A smoke" is not a shape** — `smoke:cli` uses the first two and `smoke:tui`
the second, while only the config-driven web smokes use the third. Pick by the
row, never by the caller's category.

- **In-process HTTP — `createTestServerHttp`.** The caller *constructs* the
  server and owns its lifecycle. No subprocess, no JSON config, no showcase
  config to pick. This is the shape for anything needing HTTP/SSE, a specific
  tool set, or the modern handler — and it is not test-only: `scripts/smoke-cli.mjs`
  starts one in the smoke process so it can read back the headers the CLI sent.
- **Spawned stdio — `getTestMcpServerCommand()`.** The test hands the built
  fixture's `{ command, args }` to a stdio transport (or to the built CLI), and
  the transport spawns it. A subprocess *is* started, but **still no config
  file**: that entry point runs the stdio server's default config, so there is
  nothing to pick. Reach for it when stdio is the point (`InspectorClient` over
  stdio, the CLI's out-of-process E2E suite) and the default tool set is enough.
  A caller may also just *name* the built entry rather than connect to it —
  `smoke:cli` and `smoke:tui` write it into a `--catalog` as
  `{ type: "stdio", command: node, args: [<built entry>] }` — which is still
  this shape, and still the build.
- **Spawned composable HTTP — `server-composable.js --config <name>.json`.**
  Picking the showcase config and the protocol era applies **to this shape**,
  whoever starts it. Two consumers, and they differ only in who runs the second
  process:
  - **A script.** `scripts/smoke-web-elicitation.mjs` spawns it directly;
    `scripts/lib/mcp-app-flow.mjs` (`startMcpAppServer`) does it for
    `smoke:web:app`, `smoke:web:tabs` and `pack:verify`. These are automated and
    config-driven, and the whole of this skill applies to them. ⚠️ **Not every
    smoke is here** — `smoke:cli` and `smoke:tui` use the two shapes above and
    pick no config at all.
  - **You, in a terminal**, with the Inspector in another — `Run one by hand`
    below.

⚠️ **The build applies to all three.** Every shape resolves
`test-servers/build/` — the two API-driven ones through the
`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector-test-server` alias, the composable one by
running the emitted `.js` directly — so `Build first` and its stale-build hazard
are **not** guidance for one path. Read that section whichever shape you are in.

### Automated, in-process HTTP: build the server from the API

```ts
import {
  createTestServerHttp,
  type TestServerHttp,
  createTestServerInfo,
  createEchoTool,
} from "@modelcontextprotocol/inspector-test-server";

let server: TestServerHttp | null = null;

afterEach(async () => {
  // Stop it even when the assertion threw, or the port leaks into the next test.
  if (server) {
    try {
      await server.stop();
    } catch {
      // ignore
    }
    server = null;
  }
});

it("…", async () => {
  const started = createTestServerHttp({
    serverInfo: createTestServerInfo("excluded-tools-test", "1.0.0"),
    tools: [createEchoTool()],
    // `modern: {}` opts the fixture into the 2026-07-28 handler; omit it for legacy.
  });
  await started.start();
  server = started;

  // `started.url` is the bound URL — read it, never reconstruct it from a port.
  // …connect an InspectorClient to it and assert.
});
```

The reference test is
[`clients/web/src/test/integration/mcp/inspectorClient-excluded-tools.test.ts`](../../../clients/web/src/test/integration/mcp/inspectorClient-excluded-tools.test.ts)
— read it before writing a new one; it is the shape fixture-backed integration
tests follow when the server is built in-process. (Stdio-backed ones follow the
next subsection instead.)

Four mechanics of this path:

- **The factories come from one barrel.** `createTestServerHttp` /
  `createTestServerStdio` build the server; the `create*Tool`,
  `create*Resource` and `create*Prompt` fixtures in
  `test-servers/src/test-server-fixtures.ts` populate it;
  `createTestServerInfo` fills in `serverInfo`. Prefer an existing fixture
  factory to hand-writing a `ToolDefinition` — that is what makes the fixture a
  shared one.
- **`start()` then `stop()`, and `stop()` in an `afterEach`.** The server binds a
  real port, so a test that throws before stopping leaks it into the rest of the
  file.
- **Read `started.url`.** `createTestServerHttp` resolves through
  `findAvailablePort()`, which walks upward when the port is taken, so an
  assumed port is the same bug the two-process path has.
- **Era is a constructor option, not a config file.** `modern: {}` on the config
  object selects the modern handler; the client side picks its own negotiation
  (`eraToVersionNegotiation`). The showcase-config era table below does not
  apply.

⚠️ **The barrel is an alias to the BUILD, not to the source** —
`vitest.shared.mts` maps `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector-test-server` to
`test-servers/build/index.js`. So `Build first` applies to this path in full,
stale-build hazard included: an edit to `test-servers/src` that is not rebuilt
is invisible to an in-process test exactly as it is to a spawned one.

### Automated, spawned stdio: hand over the command

```ts
import { getTestMcpServerCommand } from "@modelcontextprotocol/inspector-test-server";

const { command, args } = getTestMcpServerCommand();
const client = new InspectorClient(
  { type: "stdio", command, args },
  { environment: { transport: createTransportNode } },
);
await client.connect();
// … afterEach → client.disconnect(), which is what stops the child.
```

`getTestMcpServerCommand()` returns `node <test-servers/build/test-server-stdio.js>`.
Three consequences:

- **You do not own the process, the transport does.** There is no `start()` /
  `stop()` pair — disconnecting the client is what reaps the child, so the
  `afterEach` that matters is `client.disconnect()`.
- **No config is selected and none can be.** That entry point starts the stdio
  server on its **default** config, so the showcase-config table and the
  protocol-era guidance below do not apply. If the case needs a specific tool
  set or the modern handler, it is an in-process HTTP test, not this.
- **It is still the build.** The path comes from the module's own resolved
  location under the alias, so it is `test-servers/build/`, with the same
  staleness hazard.

The same command feeds the CLI's out-of-process E2E suite
(`clients/cli/__tests__/e2e.test.ts`), which spawns the built CLI *and* lets it
spawn the fixture. Reference tests for this shape:
`clients/web/src/test/integration/mcp/inspectorClient-response-rejected.test.ts`
and `clients/cli/__tests__/methods.test.ts`.

## Build first

Every shape above resolves generated output — the in-process one imports the
barrel, which is **aliased to `test-servers/build/index.js`**, and the stdio and
composable-config ones run emitted `.js` as real subprocesses. So the build must
exist whichever one you are in:

```sh
cd clients/web && npm run test-servers:build   # tsc -p test-servers → test-servers/build/
```

Scripts reach this through `scripts/ensure-test-servers.mjs`, which builds
**unconditionally** (once per process per repo root).

⚠️ **Unconditional emit is not a clean.** A **deleted** source file leaves its
stale `.js` behind, existence checks pass against it, and anything still
importing that module silently runs the old code — reported not as staleness but
as a product failure in whatever was being tested. So after deleting or renaming
a source file:

```sh
rm -rf test-servers/build
```

The `.tsbuildinfo` is pinned inside `build/` so that clean actually invalidates
the cache.

## Run one by hand (two processes)

This is the **spawned composable HTTP** shape from the section above, driven by
you rather than by a smoke script — the config and era guidance is the same
either way. Two processes: the test server, then the Inspector.

```sh
# 1. The server, from the repo root, with the config you picked:
node test-servers/build/server-composable.js --config test-servers/configs/<name>.json
```

```sh
# 2. The Inspector, in another terminal (needs a built launcher — `npm run build`):
node clients/launcher/build/index.js --web
```

Then add the server in the Inspector using the URL the first process announced.

Two mechanics that bite:

- **The server announces its URL on _stderr_**, not stdout (`console.error` in
  `server-composable.ts`). Watching stdout alone looks like a server that never
  started.
- **The bound port is not necessarily the config's.** `createTestServerHttp`
  resolves through `findAvailablePort()`, which walks upward when the configured
  port is taken — so read the announced URL rather than assuming.

## Pick the right protocol era

Each config in [`docs/test-servers.md`](../../../docs/test-servers.md) says
which era to connect with. The default is **legacy**; configs setting
`transport.modern` need **Protocol Era = Modern**. Connecting with the wrong era
usually looks like a missing capability rather than an error.

## Common starting points

| Want to see | Config |
| --- | --- |
| An MCP App in the Apps tab | `mcp-app-http.json` (legacy) |
| An App-rendered elicitation | `app-elicitation-http.json` (legacy) |
| `Mcp-*` headers + the modern error taxonomy | `modern-network-http.json` |
| A tool result's `structuredContent` section | `structured-output-http.json` (legacy) |
| RFC 6570 resource-template expansion | `rfc6570-templates-http.json` |
| OAuth token revocation on clear | `oauth-revocation-http.json` (legacy) |
| A token endpoint the SDK refuses  | `oauth-insecure-token-endpoint-http.json` (legacy) |
| Cancelling a call mid-flight | `cancellation-modern-http.json` (modern) |

## Adding a config or preset

- Presets live in `test-servers/src/preset-registry.ts`; configs in
  `test-servers/configs/*.json`.
- A new showcase config gets a row in `docs/test-servers.md` saying what to do
  and what the broken build did — the "what it looked like broken" half is what
  makes the fixture reproducible later.
- ⚠️ **An `outputSchema` override must ride a tool that returns structured
  content.** A conforming client validates the result against the advertised
  schema, so an override on a preset returning none makes every call fail with
  "declares an output schema but returned no structured content".
