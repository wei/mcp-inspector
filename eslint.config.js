// Root-level lint gate for first-party code that no client's own `eslint .`
// (each scoped to its own directory) reaches: the shared `core/` package
// (#1689) and the root-owned "shared" surface — `test-servers/src/**`, the
// root `vitest.shared.mts`, and this config file itself (#1767). `core/` is
// isomorphic TypeScript (browser-side OAuth + Node backends + shared runtime);
// the shared surface is Node-only tooling/tests.
//
// `core/react/` gets the React hook rules, and "neither surface has JSX" was
// never a reason to withhold them — the hook rules judge hooks, not JSX, and
// that directory is nothing but hooks. Until #2192 the whole
// `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` set, `set-state-in-effect` included, had never
// looked at them: the plugin was a devDependency of `clients/web` only, and
// Node resolution walks up rather than down, so the root could not load it.
// That is how the prop-into-effect re-sync #1955 fixed sat here unreported
// while the identical shape was an error over in `clients/web/src`. The plugin
// is now a root devDependency and the block below applies it.
//
// Scoped to `core/react/**` rather than all of `core/**`: everything else
// there is plain isomorphic TypeScript, and the rules key off the `use`-prefix
// naming convention, so a non-React `useFoo` helper elsewhere in `core/` would
// be judged as a hook it is not.
//
// Type-aware linting for the `core/` and shared surfaces below.
// `no-floating-promises` needs type information, which
// `tseslint.configs.recommended` (the non-type-aware set) does not provide —
// so a block of its own adds a parser project (#1959).
//
// `tsconfig.lint.json` exists for this and nothing else: the root has no
// tsconfig of its own (`core/` is typechecked through `clients/web`'s
// `tsc -b`, `test-servers/src` through `clients/cli`'s test project), and a
// parser project must literally *contain* every file it is asked to lint.
